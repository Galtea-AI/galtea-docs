<Update label="2025-04-28" description="Monitorization and UI improvements">
  ## Monitoring Is Live!

Real-world user interactions with your products can now be fully monitored and analyzed. Using the Galtea SDK, you can trigger evaluations in a production environment and view how different versions perform with real users. [Read more here](/sdk/api/evaluation-task-service#monitoring-user-interactions-in-production).

## Improved Galtea Simulation Tests

Our simulation-generated tests have been upgraded—delivering higher-quality outcomes. Red teaming tests can now be directed to validate even more specific aspects of various security standards, such as OWASP, MITRE ATLAS, and NIST.

## New Analytics Page

A completely redesigned analytics page is now available! It features:
- **Enhanced Filtering Capabilities.**
- **Improved Data Clarity and Layout.**

The new design not only raises the clarity and density of data presentation but also improves your overall user experience.

> And with monitoring active, you can see production evaluation results in real time on this page!

## User Experience Enhancements

We’re continuously refining the platform based on your feedback. This week’s improvements include:

- **Customizable Evaluation Tasks List:**  
  You can now select which metrics you are interested in, so the evaluation tasks list only shows the ones you need.

- **Enhanced Evaluation List Filtering:**  
  Easily filter evaluations by versions, evaluations, and tests.

- **Smart Table Sorting:**  
  When you apply a custom sort, the default (usually creation date) is automatically disabled.
