## Monitoring Is Live!

Real-world user interactions with your products can now be fully monitored and analyzed. Using the Galtea SDK, you can trigger evaluations in a production environment and view how different versions perform with real users. [Read more here](/sdk/tutorials/monitor-production-responses-to-user-queries).

## Improved Galtea Red Teaming Tests

Our simulation-generated tests have been upgraded—delivering higher-quality outcomes. Red teaming tests can now be directed to validate even more specific aspects of various security standards, such as OWASP, MITRE ATLAS, and NIST. Specifically, we have improved **jailbreak** attacks, in addition to new **financial attacks** and **toxicity** prompts.

## New Analytics Page

A completely redesigned analytics page is now available! It features:
- **Enhanced Filtering Capabilities.**
- **Improved Data Clarity and Layout.**

The new design not only raises the clarity and density of data presentation but also improves your overall user experience.

> And with monitoring active, you can see production evaluation results in real time on this page!

## User Experience Enhancements

We're continuously refining the platform based on your feedback. This week's improvements include:

- **Customizable Evaluations List:**  
  You can now select which metrics you are interested in, so the evaluations list only shows the ones you need.

- **Enhanced Evaluation List Filtering:**  
  Easily filter evaluations by versions, evaluations, tests and test groups.

- **Enhanced Test List Filtering:**  
  Easily filter tests by its group.

- **Smart Table Sorting:**  
  When you apply a custom sort, the default (usually creation date) is automatically disabled.
