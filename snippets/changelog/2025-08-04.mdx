## Customizable Metrics via Custom Prompts

We've expanded our metric library to include fully customizable metrics via custom prompts. This feature allows you to create metrics tailored to your specific needs, giving you more control over how your LLM is evaluated.

## New Classical Metrics

We've added four new classical metrics to our library:

- **Text Similarity**: Measures the similarity between two pieces of text, such as sentences or paragraphs.
- **Text Match**: Checks if two pieces of text are identical or very similar.
- **Spatial Match**: Evaluates the similarity between two spatial representations, such as images or 3D models.
- **IoU (Intersection over Union)**: Calculates the similarity between two sets of bounding boxes, such as those used in object detection tasks.

These new metrics complement our existing evaluation suite and are perfect for scenarios requiring deterministic, rule-based scoring.
