## Create Custom Judges via Your Own Prompts

You can now define **Custom Judge** metrics by crafting your own evaluation prompts during metric creation. This allows you to encode your domain-specific rubrics, product constraints, or behavioral guidelines directly into the metricâ€”giving you precise control over how LLM outputs are assessed. Simply write your prompt, specify the scoring logic, and Galtea will leverage LLM-as-a-judge techniques to evaluate outputs according to your standards.

## New Deterministic Metrics

Four new deterministic metrics are now available:

- **Text Similarity**: Quantifies how closely two texts resemble each other using character-level fuzzy matching.
- **Text Match**: Checks if generated text is sufficiently similar to a reference string, returning a pass/fail based on a threshold.
- **Spatial Match**: Verifies if a predicted box aligns with a reference box using IoU scoring, producing a pass/fail result.
- **IoU (Intersection over Union)**: Computes the overlap ratio between predicted and reference boxes for alignment and detection tasks.

These new metrics complement our existing evaluation suite and are perfect for scenarios requiring deterministic, rule-based scoring.

## Dashboard Redesign: Second Iteration

We've launched the second iteration of our redesigned dashboard with a refreshed visual language focused on clarity and usability. Key improvements include:

- **Modern Forms**: Forms have been modernized to provide a more intuitive and visually appealing user experience, as well as giving a more professional look to the Dashboard.

This redesign represents our commitment to delivering a more intuitive and visually appealing user experience while maintaining the powerful functionality you rely on.
