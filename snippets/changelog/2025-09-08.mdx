<Update label="2025-09-08" description="Smarter Simulations, Bulk Uploads, and Streamlined Onboarding">
## More Realistic Conversation Simulations

Our **[Conversation Simulator](/concepts/product/test/case/conversation-simulator)** has been significantly upgraded to generate more realistic and human-like interactions. The simulator's evaluation of stopping criteria is now more precise, ensuring that your multi-turn dialogue tests conclude under the correct conditions and provide more accurate insights into your AI's conversational abilities.

Additionally, conversations generated during simulations are now linked to the specific [product version](/concepts/product/version) they were created with, allowing for better tracking and traceability.
<Warning>
  To enable version tracking for simulated conversations, please upgrade to Galtea SDK version `1.8.1` or higher.
</Warning>

## Bulk Document Uploads for Test Generation

You can now upload multiple files at once using **ZIP archives** to generate comprehensive [test suites](/concepts/product/test). This feature streamlines the process of creating tests from large document collections, saving you time and effort when building out your evaluation scenarios. For more details, see the [test creation documentation](/sdk/api/test/create).

## Streamlined Onboarding Experience

Getting started with a new [product](/concepts/product) is now faster than ever. When you create a new product in the Galtea dashboard, an initial [version](/concepts/product/version) is now created automatically. This simplification streamlines the setup process and helps you get to your first evaluation more quickly.

## Enhanced Document Processing

We've improved our backend for processing documents used in test generation. This enhancement leads to more accurate and relevant test cases being created from your knowledge bases, improving the overall quality of your evaluations.
