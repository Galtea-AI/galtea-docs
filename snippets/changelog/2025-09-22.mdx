<Update label="2025-09-22" description="Consistent Sorting, Improved Navigation, and SAML SSO">
## Consistent Sorting and Enhanced Navigation

We've made significant usability improvements to the platform. Table sorting is now more consistent and persistent; you can navigate away, refresh the page, and your chosen sort order will remain, ensuring a smoother workflow. Additionally, navigating from an [Evaluation Task](/concepts/product/version/session/evaluation-task) is easier than ever. You can now right-click on any task in the table or use the dropdown menu in the details page to jump directly to the related [Test Case](/concepts/product/test/case) or [Session](/concepts/product/version/session).

## Upvote and Downvote Test Cases

To help teams better curate their test suites, we've introduced a voting system for [Test Cases](/concepts/product/test/case). You can now upvote or downvote test cases directly from the Dashboard, providing a quick feedback loop on test case quality and relevance.

## SAML SSO Authentication

Organizations can now enhance their security by configuring SAML SSO for authentication. This allows for seamless and secure access to the Galtea platform through your existing identity provider.

## Improved Misuse Resilience Metric

The **[Misuse Resilience](/concepts/metric-type/misuse-resilience)** metric has been enhanced to accept the full product context. This allows for a more accurate and comprehensive evaluation of your model's ability to resist misuse by leveraging a deeper understanding of your product's intended capabilities and boundaries.

## New Analytics Filter

The analytics page now includes a filter for Test Case language. This allows you to narrow down your analysis and gain more precise insights into the performance of your multilingual models.

Enjoy the improvements!
