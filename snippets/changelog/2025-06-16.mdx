<Update label="2025-06-16" description="Major Platform Overhaul & SDK v2">

## Major Platform Overhaul

We've been hard at work reorganizing and expanding the Galtea platform to handle more use cases and prepare for exciting future features. This release brings significant improvements to the [dashboard](https://platform.galtea.ai/), [SDK](/sdk/introduction), and test generation.

## Dashboard Enhancements

- **Reorganized [Version](/concepts/product/version), [Test](/concepts/product/test), and [Evaluation](/concepts/product/version/session/evaluation) Views:**  
  Detailed views have been streamlined and improved for clearer insights.

- **New [Sessions](/concepts/product/version/session) Visualizations:**  
  Easily organize and navigate conversations through our new Sessions feature.

- **Evaluations Visualization Removed:**  
  The dashboard now focuses on **Sessions** and **Evaluations** as the primary elements.

- **Better Filters Across Tables:**  
  Quickly find what you need with improved filtering capabilities on the dashboard.

- **General Bug Fixes & UX Improvements:**  
  Enjoy smoother interactions, clearer tooltips, and more intuitive code snippets.

## SDK v2 Released

The new Galtea SDK v2 is here! It includes breaking changes to simplify workflows and add session support. Check out the [migration guide](/migration-to-v2) for a smooth transition.

- **Implicit Session Creation:**  
  Sessions are created automatically when needed for evaluations.

- **Repurposed [evaluations.create()](/sdk/api/evaluation/create):**  
  The old method is replaced by `create_single_turn()` for test-based evaluations, while `create()` now exclusively handles [session-based](/sdk/api/session) evaluations.

- **New [evaluations.create_single_turn()](/sdk/api/evaluation/create-single-turn) Method:**  
  Use this for single-turn [test cases](/sdk/api/test-case). It now requires `version_id` instead of `evaluation_id`.

- **Simplified [Version Creation](/sdk/api/version/create):**  
  The `galtea.versions.create()` method now accepts all properties directly, no need for an `optional_props` dictionary.

- **[Sessions Support](/sdk/api/session/service):**  
  Group multiple inference results under a single session for better multi-turn tracking using `galtea.sessions.create()`.

## Improved Test Case Generation

- **Smarter Test Coverage:**  
  [Test cases](/concepts/product/test/case) are now distributed more intelligently across your documents for better coverage based on the number of questions you choose to generate.

- **Single Threat per Red Teaming Test:**  
  Red Teaming Tests now only allow a single threat per test, ensuring clearer results.

Enjoy the upgrade!
