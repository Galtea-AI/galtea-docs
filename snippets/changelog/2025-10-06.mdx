<Update label="2025-10-06" description="Platform Simplification, New Conversational Metrics, and Major Usability Upgrades">
## Platform Simplification and SDK v3.0

We've undertaken a major simplification of our core concepts to make the platform more intuitive. `Evaluation Tasks` are now simply **[Evaluations](/concepts/product/version/session/evaluation)**, and `Metric Types` have been renamed to **[Metrics](/concepts/metric)**. The old parent `Evaluations` entity has been removed entirely. These changes streamline the workflow and clarify the relationship between different parts of Galtea.

To support this, we've released a new major version of our SDK. Please see the **[Migration to v3.0 guide](/migration-to-v3)** for detailed instructions on updating your projects.

## New Conversational Metrics

We're excited to introduce two new metrics designed specifically for evaluating conversational AI:

- **[User Objective Accomplished](/concepts/metric/user-objective-accomplished):** Evaluates whether the user's stated goal was successfully and correctly achieved during the conversation.
- **[User Satisfaction](/concepts/metric/user-satisfaction):** Assesses the user's overall experience, focusing on efficiency and sentiment, to gauge their satisfaction with the interaction.

## Enhanced Test Case Feedback and Management

Improving test quality is now a more collaborative process. When upvoting or downvoting a **[Test Case](/concepts/product/test/case)**, you can now add a `user_score_reason` to provide valuable context for your feedback.

Additionally, you can now filter test cases by their score directly via the SDK using the `user_score` parameter in the **[`test_cases.list()`](/sdk/api/test-case/list)** method.

## Dashboard and SDK Usability Improvements

We've rolled out several updates to make your workflow smoother and more efficient:

- **Improved Dashboard Navigation:** Navigating between related entities like Tests, Test Cases, and Evaluations is now more intuitive. We've also adjusted table interactionsâ€”you can now single-click a row to select and copy text without navigating away. To see an entity's details, simply right-click the row.
- **Efficient Batch Fetching in SDK:** The SDK now allows you to fetch objects by providing a list of IDs (e.g., fetching all [Test Cases](/sdk/api/test-case/list) for a list of Test IDs at once), significantly improving usability for batch operations.

## General Improvements
This release also includes numerous performance optimizations and minor UI/UX enhancements across the entire platform to provide a faster and more polished experience.
