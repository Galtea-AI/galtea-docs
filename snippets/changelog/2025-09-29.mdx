<Update label="2025-09-29" description="Generate Scenarios from Quality Tests, URL Validation Metric, and Platform Boost">
## Create Conversational Scenarios from Your Quality Tests

You can now generate comprehensive **[Scenario Based Tests](/concepts/product/test/scenario-tests)** directly from your existing **[Quality Tests](/concepts/product/test/quality-tests)**. This powerful feature allows you to transform your single-turn, gold-standard test cases into realistic, multi-turn conversational scenarios, significantly accelerating the process of evaluating your AI's dialogue capabilities.

## New Deterministic Metric: URL Validation

We've added the **[URL Validation](/concepts/metric/url-validation)** metric to our deterministic evaluation suite. It ensures that all URLs in your modelâ€™s output are safe, properly formatted with HTTPS, and resolvable. It includes strict validation and SSRF protection, making it essential for any application that generates external links.

## Platform Enhancements and Performance Boost

We've rolled out major performance improvements across the platform, with a special focus on the analytics views, making them faster and more responsive. This update also includes several minor visual fixes, such as ensuring icons render correctly in different themes, to provide a smoother and more polished user experience.
