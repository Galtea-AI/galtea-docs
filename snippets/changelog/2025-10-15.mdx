<Update label="2025-10-15" description="Product Policies, New Red Teaming Strategies, and Smarter Test Generation">
## Define Product Behavior with Policies

[Products](/concepts/product) now accept a set of policies describing how they should behave in specific situations. This allows you to set explicit rules, such as requiring a disclaimer for financial advice or defining standard responses for out-of-scope questions, to ensure consistent and safe model behavior.

## Advanced Red Teaming Strategies

We've added five new, sophisticated [red teaming strategies](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-strategies) to help you uncover more complex vulnerabilities. These strategies use your **Product Description** to create highly contextual and evasive prompts:

-   **Persuasive Content:** Disguises malicious requests as legitimate business tasks.
-   **Creative Writing:** Reframes harmful prompts as creative exercises.
-   **Data Analysis:** Hides malicious intent within analytical or data-generation tasks.
-   **Bait and Switch:** Lowers model defenses with benign queries before introducing the adversarial prompt.
-   **Empathetic Framing:** Uses emotional manipulation to pressure the model into unsafe compliance.

## Smarter Test Generation Engine

Our test generation capabilities have been significantly upgraded for both Quality and Red Teaming tests:

-   **New Quality Test Engine:** The engine for generating [Quality Tests](/concepts/product/test/quality-tests) has been rebuilt to produce higher-quality test cases. It can now also incorporate and validate the new product policies you define.
-   **Faster Red Teaming Generation:** The generation process for [Red Teaming Tests](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-tests) is now more reliable and significantly faster, allowing you to build robust security evaluations more efficiently.

## Platform Usability and Performance

We've rolled out several enhancements to improve your workflow and the platform's reliability:

-   **Deletion Confirmations:** To prevent accidental data loss, the platform will now ask for confirmation before deleting key entities like Test Cases, Evaluations, and Versions.
-   **Improved Table Experience:** The performance and user experience of data tables and their filters have been optimized for a smoother, more responsive interface.
