<Update label="2025-11-24" description="Granular credit tracking, security improvements, and better SDK validation">
## Granular Credit Consumption and Transparency

We've updated our credit system to provide more granularity and transparency. You can now see exactly where your credits are being consumed, giving you detailed visibility into your usage patterns and helping you manage resources more effectively.

## Platform Robustness and Security

We've improved the overall robustness of the platform to ensure higher uptime and reliability. Additionally, we have increased safety by implementing rate limiting on our authentication endpoints, providing better protection against abuse and unauthorized access attempts.

## Improved SDK File Validation

We've enhanced file validation within the SDK. When uploading files—for example, when creating a [Test](/sdk/api/test/create) using `test_file_path` or `ground_truth_file_path`—you will now receive stricter validation and clearer, more descriptive error messages to help you debug issues faster.
