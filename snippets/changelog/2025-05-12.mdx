<Update label="2025-05-12" description="New Conversation Evaluation and Extended Data Generation Capabilities">

## New Conversation Evaluation Metrics

You can now evaluate conversations with greater precision using these new metrics:
- **Role Adherence** - Assess how well an AI stays within its defined role
- **Knowledge Retention** - Measure how effectively information is remembered throughout a conversation
- **Conversation Completeness** - Evaluate whether all user queries were fully addressed
- **Conversation Relevancy** - Determine if responses remain on-topic and purposeful

## Enhanced Security Framework

We've significantly improved user access management by implementing an **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)** strategy, providing more granular control over who can access what within your organization.

## Extended Data Generation Capabilities

Our data generation tools have been expanded with:

- **Catalan Language Support** - Create synthetic data in Catalan to enhance your multilingual applications
- **Added support for text-based files** - Upload your knowledge base in virtually any text-based format including JSON, HTML, Markdown, and more

## Improved Test Creation Experience

We've enhanced the clarity of threat selection in the Test Creation form. The selection now displays both the threat and which security frameworks that threat covers, making it easier to align your testing with specific security standards.

## Analytics & Navigation Enhancements

- **Reduced Clutter in Analytics Filters** - Tests and Versions filtering now only display elements that have been used in an evaluation
- **Streamlined Task Navigation** - Clicking the "input" cell in the evaluation tasks table now navigates directly to the associated Test Case

## Bug Fixes & Improvements

We've resolved several issues to ensure a smoother experience:
- Fixed a bug that could trigger an infinite loop in the Test Cases List of the dashboard
- Addressed multiple small UI glitches and errors throughout the platform

Enjoy these improvements and as always, we welcome your feedback!
