## Enhanced Analytics with Improved Version Comparisons

The Analytics views have received significant improvements to make data analysis more efficient and user-friendly. Key enhancements include:

- **Streamlined Chart Comparisons:** Charts now support easier side-by-side version comparisons, helping you quickly identify performance differences across iterations.
- **Optimized Filter Layout:** Filters no longer occupy valuable screen real estate, giving you more space to focus on your analytics data and insights.
- **Improved Visual Clarity:** Enhanced data presentation makes it easier to interpret results and make informed decisions about your AI systems.

These improvements build upon our existing [analytics capabilities](/sdk/tutorials/create-evaluation) to provide a more seamless evaluation experience.

## Strengthened Authentication and Security

We've implemented more secure and robust authentication mechanisms across the platform. These behind-the-scenes security enhancements provide better protection for your data and ensure reliable access to your Galtea workspace, giving you peace of mind when working with sensitive AI evaluation data.

## Advanced PDF Knowledge Extraction

Our document processing capabilities have been significantly improved for PDF files. The enhanced extraction algorithms now provide more accurate and comprehensive knowledge retrieval from PDF documents, making it easier to create relevant [test cases](/concepts/product/test) and evaluation task scenarios from your existing documentation and knowledge bases.
