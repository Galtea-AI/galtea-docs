## A Fresh New Look for the Dashboard

We've polished the dashboard with a subtle but significant UI refresh. Expect updated colors, clearer icons, and more consistent dialogs designed to create a smoother, more intuitive, and visually consistent workflow.

## Enhanced Security and Performance

We've bolstered the platform's security with improved user authentication mechanisms to better protect your data. Alongside this, we've enhanced how we handle concurrent requests, leading to better performance and reliability, especially during high-traffic periods.

## Smarter & Faster Red Teaming Generation

Creating [Red Teaming tests](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-tests) is now better than ever. We've improved language control during generation for more robust and relevant tests, even when no specific language is provided. Plus, we've optimized the generation process for significantly faster test creation, allowing you to build robust security evaluations more efficiently.
