<Update label="2025-06-23" description="Quality Test Generation, Metric Tags, and Product Details">
## Generate Quality Tests from Examples

You can now create Quality Tests directly from your own examples using the new **Few Shots** parameter. This makes it easier to tailor tests to your specific use cases and ensure your models are evaluated on the scenarios that matter most. [Learn more about test creation](/sdk/api/test/create).

## Metric Type Tags

[Metric Types](/concepts/metric-type) now support **tags** for easier classification and discovery. Quickly find and organize metrics relevant to your projects. [See all metric types](/concepts/metric-type).

## Enhanced Product Details

[Products](/concepts/product) now include new detail fields:
- **Capabilities**: What your product can do.
- **Inabilities**: Known limitations.
- **Security Boundaries**: Define the security scope and constraints.

These additions help you document and communicate your product’s strengths and boundaries more clearly. [Read about product details](/concepts/product).

## General Improvements

We’ve made various bug fixes and UX/UI improvements across the Dashboard, SDK, and more, making your experience smoother and more reliable.
