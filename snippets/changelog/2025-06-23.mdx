## Generate Quality Tests from Examples

You can now create Quality Tests directly from your own examples using the new **Few Shots** parameter. This makes it easier to tailor tests to your specific use cases and ensure your models are evaluated on the scenarios that matter most. [Learn more about test creation](/sdk/api/test/create).

## Metric Type Tags

[Metric Types](/concepts/metric-type) now support **tags** for easier classification and discovery. Quickly find and organize metrics relevant to your projects. [See all metric types](/concepts/metric-type).
