<Update label="2025-06-30" description="New Metric, More Red Teaming Strategies and Better Usability">
## Introducing the Factual Accuracy Metric

We've added a new **Factual Accuracy** metric to our evaluation toolkit! This [non-deterministic metric](/concepts/metric-type/factual-accuracy) measures whether the information in your model's output is factually correct when compared to a trusted reference answer. It's particularly valuable for RAG and question answering systems where accuracy is paramount.

The metric uses an LLM-as-a-judge approach to compare key facts between your model's output and the expected answer, helping you catch hallucinations and ensure your AI provides reliable information to users. [Read the full documentation here](/concepts/metric-type/factual-accuracy).

## Enhanced Red Teaming with New Attack Strategies

Our red teaming capabilities just got more sophisticated! We've added two powerful new [attack strategies](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-strategies):

- **Biblical Strategy**: Transforms adversarial prompts into biblical/ancient scripture style using poetic and symbolic language to disguise malicious intent while preserving meaning.
- **Math Prompt Strategy**: Encodes harmful requests into formal mathematical notation using group theory concepts to obscure the intent from standard text analysis.

These strategies join our existing arsenal to help you test your AI's defenses against increasingly creative attack vectors that real-world adversaries might use. [See all available red teaming strategies](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-strategies).

## Smarter Red Teaming Test Generation

We've significantly improved how [red teaming tests](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-tests) are generated. Our system now takes even more factors into account when creating adversarial test cases:

- **Product-Aware Generation**: Tests are now more precisely tailored to your specific product's strengths, weaknesses, and operational boundaries.
- **Context-Sensitive Attacks**: The generation process better understands your product's intended use cases to craft more relevant and challenging scenarios.
- **Enhanced Threat Modeling**: Our algorithms now consider a broader range of factors when determining the most effective attack vectors for your particular AI system.

This means your [red teaming tests](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-tests) will be more effective at uncovering real vulnerabilities and edge cases specific to your product.

## Better Metric Source Visibility and Management

Understanding where your metrics come from is now easier than ever! We've enhanced the platform to provide clearer visibility into metric sources:

- **Source Classification**: All metrics are now clearly labeled with their source - whether they're from established frameworks, custom Galtea implementations, or other origins.
- **Enhanced Filtering**: You can now filter metrics by their source to quickly find the evaluation criteria that best fit your needs.
- **Improved Descriptions**: Metric descriptions now include more detailed information about their origins and implementation, with links to relevant documentation.

The three main metric sources you'll see are:
- **Galtea**: Custom metrics designed specifically for your needs, like our new Factual Accuracy metric
- **G-Eval**: Framework-based metrics that use evaluation criteria or steps for assessment
- **Established Frameworks**: Metrics adapted from proven evaluation libraries and methodologies

This transparency helps you make more informed decisions about which metrics to use for your specific evaluation needs.

Enjoy these improvements, and as always, we'd love to hear your feedback on these new features!
