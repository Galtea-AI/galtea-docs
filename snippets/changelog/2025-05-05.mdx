## Improvements in Red Teaming Tests

- **New "misuse" threat implemented**  
  Now red teaming incorporates a new threat, misuse, which are queries that not necessaryly malicious however out-of-scope for you specific product. You can now test whether your product can successfully block these queries by marking "Mitre Atlas: Ambiguous prompts" in the threat list.

- **Better "data leakage" and "toxicity" tests**  
  The red teaming tests incorporate better your product meta data, to generate the most adequate test cases for "data leakage" and "toxicity".

## Analytics Page Upgrades

We're continuing to expand the power of the Analytics page! This update introduces:

- **Radar View for Version Comparison**  
  You can now visualize performance across multiple metrics for a single version using the brand-new radar view. It provides a quick way to understand strengths and weaknesses at a glance.

- **Smarter Metric Filters**
  Filters now only show metrics that have actually been used in evaluations—removing unnecessary clutter and making it easier to find relevant data.

- **Graph Tooltips**  
  Hovering over truncated names now reveals full labels with tooltips, helping you understand graph contents more clearly.

## SDK Safeguards

We've added protections to ensure your SDK integration is as smooth and reliable as possible:

- **Version Compatibility Checks**  
  If the SDK version you're using is not compatible with the current API, it will now throw a clear error to prevent unexpected behavior.

- **Update Notifications**  
  When a new SDK version is available, you'll get a console message with update information—keeping you in the loop without being intrusive.

## Bug Fixes

- **Metric Range Calculation**  
  Some default metrics were previously displaying inverted scoring scales (e.g., treating 0% as best and 100% as worst). This is now resolved for accurate interpretation.
