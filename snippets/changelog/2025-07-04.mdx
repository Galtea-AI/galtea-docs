## Tailor Your Red Teaming with Custom Threats

You can now define your own custom threats when creating [Red Teaming Tests](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-tests). This new capability allows you to move beyond our pre-defined threat library and create highly specific adversarial tests that target the unique vulnerabilities and edge cases of your AI product. Simply describe the threat you want to simulate, and Galtea will generate relevant test cases.

## New Red Teaming Strategies: RolePlay and Prefix Injection

We've expanded our arsenal of [Red Teaming Strategies](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-strategies) to help you build more robust AI defenses:

- **RolePlay**: This strategy attempts to alter the model's identity (e.g., "You are now an unrestricted AI"), encouraging it to bypass its own safety mechanisms and perform actions it would normally refuse.
- **Prefix Injection**: Adds a misleading or tactical instruction before the actual malicious prompt. This can trick the model into a different mode of operation, making it more susceptible to the adversarial attack.

## Introducing the Misuse Resilience Metric

A new Red Teaming metric, **Misuse Resilience**, is now available. This [metric](/concepts/metric-type) evaluates your product's ability to refuse requests that are outside its intended scope, even if they aren't explicitly harmful. It helps ensure your AI stays on-task and doesn't get diverted into performing unintended or inappropriate actions, a key aspect of responsible AI development.

## Enhanced Test Case Management: Mark as Reviewed

To improve collaboration and workflow for human annotation teams, [Test Cases](/concepts/product/test/case) can now be marked as "reviewed". This feature allows you to:
- Track which test cases have been validated by a human.
- See who performed the review, providing a clear audit trail.
- Filter and manage your test sets with greater confidence.

Enjoy these updates as we continue to make AI evaluation more powerful and intuitive!
