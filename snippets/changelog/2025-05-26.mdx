## Improved Test Generation

Our test generation capabilities have been significantly upgraded:
- **Versatile Red Teaming:** Red Teaming tests are now more powerful, allowing you to employ multiple [attack strategies](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-strategies) to thoroughly probe your AI's defenses.
- **Better Synthetic Data:** We've made general improvements to the quality of synthetic data generation, ensuring your tests are more effective and realistic.

## Code Snippets Now Available on the Dashboard

We're making it easier than ever to integrate Galtea into your development process!
- **Simplified Evaluation Setup:** The "Create Evaluation" form on the dashboard has been replaced with a convenient code snippet. Simply copy and paste it directly into your project to get started.
- **Streamlined Task Creation:** Similarly, a new code snippet for "Create Evaluation Task" is now available on the dashboard, simplifying how you send evaluation data to Galtea. You can easily copy and paste this into your project.

## Usability Improvements

We've also rolled out several usability enhancements based on your feedback:
- **Enhanced Readability in Tables:** Table cells now correctly render line breaks, making it easier to view multi-line content and detailed information at a glance.
- **Controlled Test Case Generation:** To ensure optimal performance and manageability, the maximum number of test cases automatically generated for a single test from a knowledge base is now capped at 1000.

Enjoy these improvements and as always, we welcome your feedback!
