<Update label="2025-05-19" description="Platform Upgrades: Easier Onboarding, Improved UI & Finer Control">

## Streamlined Onboarding and Quicker Starts

We've revamped the platform onboarding! It's now more visually intuitive and to help new users get evaluating in no time, we now provide a default [Metric](/concepts/metric-type) and a default [Test](/concepts/product/test). This makes it easier than ever to get started with Galtea and run your first evaluation quickly.

## Deeper Insights with Visible Conversation Turns

Understanding the full context of interactions is key. You can now view the complete [conversation turns](/sdk/tutorials/evaluating-conversations) associated with your [test cases](/concepts/product/test/case) directly within the dashboard. This offers richer context, aiding in more thorough analysis and debugging of your conversational AI products.

## Dashboard Usability Boost

We're continually refining the Galtea experience. This update brings several UI enhancements across the dashboard, designed to improve overall usability and make your workflow smoother and more intuitive.

## Tailor Your Test Generation: Selectable Test Case Counts

Gain more control over your testing process! When [generating tests](/sdk/api/test/create), you can now specify the exact number of [test cases](/concepts/product/test/case) you want Galtea to create. This allows you to fine-tune the scope and depth of your tests according to your needs.

## Track Your Team's Work: Creator Attribution Displayed

Clarity in collaboration is important. Now, the user who created a [Product](/concepts/product), [Test](/concepts/product/test), [Version](/concepts/product/version), or other key assets will be clearly displayed on their respective details pages. This helps in tracking ownership and contributions within your team.

## Enhanced Table Functionality for Easier Data Navigation

Working with data tables in the dashboard is now more efficient:
- **Clear Filter Indicators:** Easily see which filters are currently applied to any table.
- **Quick Filter Reset:** A new "Clear All Filters" button allows you to reset your view with a single click.

Enjoy these improvements and as always, we welcome your feedback!
