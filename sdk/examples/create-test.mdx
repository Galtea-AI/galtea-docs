<Info>
  Tests can be generated automatically by Galtea providing a knowledge file as shown [here](/sdk/api/test/service#create-test).

  In this guide, we will show you how to create custom [tests](/concepts/product/test), where you can define the [test cases](/concepts/product/test/case).
</Info>

## Creating Tests with the SDK

[Tests](/concepts/product/test) group the [test cases](/concepts/product/test/case) that will evaluate your [product's](/concepts/product) performance. The Galtea SDK provides methods to create both [quality tests](/concepts/product/test/quality-tests) and [red teaming tests](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-tests).

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Upload Existing Test File">
    If you already have a prepared test file, you can upload it directly to the Galtea platform.

    ```python
    from galtea import Galtea

    # Initialize the SDK with your API key
    galtea = Galtea(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

    # Upload test to Galtea Platform
    test = galtea.tests.create(
        name="product-knowledge-test",
        type="QUALITY",  # Options: "QUALITY" or "RED_TEAMING"
        product_id="YOUR_PRODUCT_ID",
        test_file_path="path/to/your/test_file.csv"
    )

    print(f"Test created with ID: {test.id}")
    ```

    <Warning>
      The test file should follow the appropriate structure for either [quality tests](/concepts/product/test/quality-tests#example-quality-tests-and-file-format) or [red teaming tests](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-tests#example-red-teaming-tests-and-file-format).
    
      If the file is not correctly formatted, the test cases will not be created. But they can be created manually following [this example](/sdk/api/test-case/service#create-test-case).
    </Warning>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Create Test From Scratch">
    When you need more control over your test content, you can create test files programmatically before uploading them.

    ```python
    from galtea import Galtea
    import pandas as pd

    # Initialize the SDK with your API key
    galtea = Galtea(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

    # Prepare test data
    test_data = [
        {
            "instance_id": 0,
            "input": "What is the capital of France?", 
            "expected_output": "Paris",
            "tag": "geography",
            "context": ""
        },
        {
            "instance_id": 1,
            "input": "What is the capital of Spain?", 
            "expected_output": "Madrid",
            "tag": "geography",
            "context": ""
        }
    ]

    # Create DataFrame and save to CSV
    test_df = pd.DataFrame(test_data)
    test_file_path = 'custom_geography_test.csv'
    test_df.to_csv(test_file_path)

    # Upload test to Galtea Platform
    test = galtea.tests.create(
        name="geography-knowledge-test",
        type="QUALITY",
        product_id="YOUR_PRODUCT_ID",
        test_file_path=test_file_path
    )

    print(f"Test created with ID: {test.id}")
    ```

    <Warning>
      Make sure your test data follows the correct structure as specified in the [quality tests](/concepts/product/test/quality-tests#example-quality-tests-and-file-format) or [red teaming tests](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-tests#example-red-teaming-tests-and-file-format) documentation.
      
      If the file is not correctly formatted, the test cases will not be created. But they can be created manually following [this example](/sdk/api/test-case/service#create-test-case).
