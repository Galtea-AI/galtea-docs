You can use Galtea to log and evaluate real user interactions from your production environment. This helps you monitor your product's performance over time.

## Logging and Evaluating a Production Interaction

When your product handles a user query, you can send the interaction details to Galtea using `create_single_turn` with `is_production=True`.

```python
from galtea import Galtea

galtea = Galtea(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
VERSION_ID = "YOUR_ACTIVE_VERSION_ID"

# In your application's request handler...
def handle_user_query(user_query):
    # Your logic to get a response from your model
    model_response = your_product_function(user_query)
    
    # Log and evaluate the interaction in Galtea
    galtea.evaluation_tasks.create_single_turn(
      version_id=VERSION_ID,
      is_production=True,
      metrics=["coherence", "answer-relevancy"],
      input=user_query,
      actual_output=model_response
    )
    
    return model_response
```
