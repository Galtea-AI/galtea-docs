You can use Galtea to log and evaluate real user interactions from your production environment. This helps you monitor your product's performance over time.

## Logging and Evaluating a Production Interaction

When your product handles a user query, you can send the interaction details to Galtea using `create_single_turn` with `is_production=True`.

```python
from galtea import Galtea

galtea = Galtea(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
VERSION_ID = "YOUR_ACTIVE_VERSION_ID"

# In your application's request handler...
def handle_user_query(user_query):
    # ... your logic to get a response from your model ...
    # model_response = your_product_function(user_query)
    model_response = "This is the model's live response."
    
    # Log and evaluate the interaction in Galtea
    galtea.evaluation_tasks.create_single_turn(
      version_id=VERSION_ID,
      is_production=True,
      metrics=["coherence", "answer-relevancy"],
      input=user_query,
      actual_output=model_response
    )
    
    return model_response

# Example call
handle_user_query("What are your shipping options?")
```

<Info>
  By capturing evaluation data from production, you build a valuable repository of real-world performance metrics that can be analyzed on the Galtea dashboard to identify trends, issues, and opportunities for improvement.

<Note>
  This example focuses on single-turn production monitoring. For evaluating multi-turn conversations, please see our guide on [Evaluating Conversations](/sdk/examples/evaluating-conversations).
