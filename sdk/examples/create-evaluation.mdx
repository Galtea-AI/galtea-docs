[Evaluations](/concepts/product/evaluation) allow you to assess how well a specific [version](/concepts/product/version) of your [product](/concepts/product) performs against a set of [test cases](/concepts/product/test/case) by running individual [evaluation tasks](/concepts/product/evaluation/task).

## Creating an Evaluation

This is how to create an evaluation:

  ```python
  from galtea import Galtea

  # Initialize Galtea SDK
  galtea = Galtea(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

  # Create an evaluation
  evaluation = galtea.evaluations.create(
      test_id="YOUR_TEST_ID",
      version_id="YOUR_VERSION_ID"
  )

  print(f"Evaluation created with ID: {evaluation.id}")
  ```
  <Info>
    An evaluation links a specific version of your product to a test. This establishes the framework for running individual evaluation tasks.
  </Info>

## Running Evaluation Tasks

Once you've created an evaluation, you can run [evaluation tasks](/concepts/product/evaluation/task):

For efficiency, you can process *multiple evaluation tasks at once* using a loop and the `galtea.evaluation_tasks.create` method:

```python
# Load your test cases
test_cases = galtea.tests_cases.list(test_id="YOUR_TEST_ID")

# Evaluate all test cases
for test_case in test_cases:
    # Your product's actual response to the input
    actual_output = your_product_function(test_cases.input, test_cases.context)
    
    # Run evaluation task
    galtea.evaluation_tasks.create(
        metrics=["accuracy_v1", "relevance_v1"],
        evaluation_id=evaluation.id,
        test_case_id=test_case.id,
        actual_output=actual_output,
    )

print("All evaluation tasks submitted")
```

<Note>
  The `metrics` parameter specifies which [metric types](/concepts/metric-type) to use for evaluating the task. You can use multiple metrics simultaneously to get different perspectives on performance.
</Note>

### Customized Test Cases for Evaluation Tasks

If you want to fully customize the Evaluation Task, maybe because your Test File does not follow Galtea's format thus the test cases have not been created, you can load the test cases from the file and set them in the evaluation task in a similar way:

```python
# Load your test data
test_data = pd.read_csv("geography_test.csv")

# Process all test instances
for index, row in test_data.iterrows():
    # Your product's actual response to the input
    actual_output = your_product_function(row['input'])
    
    # Run evaluation task
    galtea.evaluation_tasks.create(
        metrics=["accuracy_v1", "relevance_v1"],
        evaluation_id=evaluation.id,
        input=row[input],
        actual_output=actual_output,
        expected_output=row[expected_output],
        context=row[context],
    )
print("All evaluation tasks submitted")
```

<Warning>
  This method is only recommended for advanced users who need to customize the evaluation tasks. For most cases, using the test cases provided by the test is the best approach.

  Using this will limit the acces to analysis tools and metrics that are available when using the standard test cases.
</Warning>

## Retrieving Evaluation Results

After running evaluation tasks, you can retrieve the results:

```python
# Get all tasks for an evaluation
tasks = galtea.evaluation_tasks.list(evaluation_id=evaluation.id)

# Analyze results
total_score = 0
for task in tasks:
    task_detail = galtea.evaluation_tasks.get(task.id)
    total_score += task_detail.score
    print(f"Task {task.id}: Score = {task_detail.score}")

avg_score = total_score / len(tasks) if tasks else 0
print(f"Average evaluation score: {avg_score}")
```
