To evaluate a product version, you run individual [evaluation tasks](/concepts/product/evaluation/task) against a set of [test cases](/concepts/product/test/case). An [Evaluation](/concepts/product/evaluation) is created implicitly to group these tasks.

## Running Evaluation Tasks

You can loop through your test cases and create evaluation tasks for each one. This allows you to assess performance across multiple metrics simultaneously.

```python
from galtea import Galtea
from datetime import datetime

# Initialize Galtea SDK
galtea = Galtea(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Assume you have a version_id and test_id
VERSION_ID = "YOUR_VERSION_ID"
TEST_ID = "YOUR_TEST_ID"

# Load your test cases
test_cases = galtea.test_cases.list(test_id=TEST_ID)

# Your product's inference function (placeholder)
def your_product_function(input_prompt, context=None):
    # In a real scenario, this would call your model
    return f"Model response to: {input_prompt}"

# Evaluate all test cases
for test_case in test_cases:
    # Your product's actual response to the input
    actual_output = your_product_function(test_case.input, test_case.context)
    
    # Run evaluation task
    galtea.evaluation_tasks.create_single_turn(
        version_id=VERSION_ID,
        test_case_id=test_case.id,
        metrics=["accuracy_v1", "relevance_v1"],
        actual_output=actual_output,
    )

print("All evaluation tasks submitted.")
```

<Note>
  The `metrics` parameter specifies which metric types to use. An `Evaluation` is automatically created behind the scenes to link this `version_id` and `test_id`.
</Note>

## Retrieving Results

After running tasks, you can retrieve the results from the platform or view them on the dashboard.

```python
# The evaluation is created implicitly, so you need to find it by listing evaluations for the product.
# This part is best done by navigating to the Galtea dashboard to see the results.
print(f"View results on the Galtea dashboard for your product.")
```
