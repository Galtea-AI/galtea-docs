To accurately **evaluate interactions within a dialogue**, certain metrics need access to the preceding turns of the conversation. This is handled by the [ `conversation_turns` parameter](/sdk/api/evaluation-task/create#param-conversation-turns).

Currently, this parameter can only be used with the following metrics, which are available by default:
  - **Role Adherence**: Measures how well the actual output adheres to a specified role.
  - **Knowledge Retention**: Assesses the model's ability to retain and use information from previous turns in the conversation.
  - **Conversational Completeness**: Evaluates whether the conversation has reached a natural and informative conclusion.
  - **Conversation Relevancy**: Assesses whether each turn in the conversation is relevant to the ongoing topic and user needs.

<Note>
  The `conversation_turns` parameter is available both in the [create evaluation task](/sdk/api/evaluation-task/create) and [create evaluation task from production](/sdk/api/evaluation-task/create-from-production) methods.

### Expected format

The `conversation_turns` parameter expects a list of dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a **single, complete exchange** (one user query and the assistant's response to it) that occurred before the current interaction being sent to our platform.

The required structure for each dictionary in the list is:
```json
{
  "input": "The user's query from that past turn",
  "actual_output": "The assistant's response from that past turn"
}
```

This is how it would look like in practice:
```python
# Example: conversation_turns list passed to create_from_production
[
  {"input": "Hi, tell me about Galtea.", "actual_output": "Galtea is an AI evaluation platform."},
  {"input": "What metrics does it support?", "actual_output": "It supports accuracy, relevance, safety metrics, and more."},
  # ... other past turns in chronological order ...
]
```

### Converting Your Application's History Format

Let's say you have a conversation history like this.

```python
conversation_history = [
  {'system': 'system', 'content': 'You are a pirate.'},
  {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Can you teach me to swim?'},
  {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Sure thing, matey! Then ye go swim with the shark.'},
  {'role': 'user', 'content': 'I am not sure if I can swim with the shark.'},
  {'role': 'assistant', 'content': 'Ye can do it!'},
]
```
Then, this would be a valid method to extract the conversation turns from the conversation history:
```python
def extract_conversation_turns(messages: list[dict]) -> list[dict]:
  conversation_turns = []
  user_query = None
  for message in messages:
    # Skip system messages or irrelevant roles if necessary
    if message['role'] == 'system':
        continue

    if message['role'] == 'user':
        # Store the user query temporarily
        user_query = message['content']
    elif message['role'] == 'assistant' and user_query is not None:
        # Found an assistant response following a user query, form a turn
        conversation_turns.append({
            "input": user_query,
            "actual_output": message['content']
        })
        # Reset user_query to wait for the next user message
        user_query = None
    # Handle edge cases: consecutive user/assistant messages if applicable

  return conversation_turns
```
