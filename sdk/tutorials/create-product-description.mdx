A **product description** is the foundation of your AI evaluation strategy in Galtea. It defines what your AI system is designed to do, enabling our platform to generate relevant test cases, create meaningful evaluations, and provide insights that matter to your specific use case.

## What Is a Product Description?

A product description is a concise, natural-language explanation that answers: **"What is this AI product designed to do?"**

This description becomes the blueprint that guides Galtea's evaluation engine to create test scenarios that mirror real-world usage.

## Why Product Descriptions Matter

Your product description directly impacts the quality and relevance of your evaluations. A well-crafted description enables Galtea to:

- Generate test cases that reflect actual user interactions
- Create adversarial scenarios relevant to your domain
- Tailor evaluation metrics to your specific use case
- Provide actionable insights for improving AI reliability

## Writing Effective Product Descriptions

### Be Specific and Purpose-Driven

Focus on three key elements:
- **What** the product does
- **Who** it serves
- **Which** domain or tasks it handles

**Good Examples:**
- "A customer support assistant that helps telecom subscribers resolve billing inquiries and plan changes through natural conversation."
- "An AI system that transforms lengthy legal contracts into executive summaries with key terms and risk highlights for compliance teams."

**Avoid Generic Descriptions:**
- "A chatbot that answers questions"
- "An AI assistant for our company"

### Focus on User Experience, Not Architecture

Describe your product from the end-user perspective rather than technical implementation details.

**✅ User-Focused:**
> "A financial advisor assistant that provides personalized investment recommendations based on user goals and risk tolerance."

**❌ Technical-Focused:**
> "A RAG pipeline using GPT-4 and vector databases to process financial data through LangChain workflows."

### Best Practices

**Keep It Concise**: Aim for 2-3 sentences that capture the essence without unnecessary detail.

**Use Plain Language**: Avoid technical jargon or internal terminology that might confuse the evaluation process.

**Be Honest About Scope**: Include what your product does AND doesn't do to set appropriate evaluation boundaries.

**Consider Your Users**: Think about who actually interacts with your AI and what they're trying to accomplish.

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Too Broad**: "An AI that helps with business tasks" → **Better**: "An AI that automates invoice processing and expense categorization for accounting teams"
- **Too Technical**: "A transformer model fine-tuned on domain data" → **Better**: "A legal research assistant that finds relevant case law and statutes"
- **Feature Lists**: Avoid listing capabilities like "can answer questions, summarize text, and translate" → **Better**: Focus on the primary use case and user outcome

## Enhanced Product Descriptions
For maximum generation effectiveness, especially for security testing, you need to provide these additional details:

### Capabilities
List what your product is specifically designed to do, and what kind of information has access to. This helps generate specifically targeted test cases.
<Info>
  <strong>Example:</strong> "Can answer questions about phone specifications, recommend devices based on user preferences, can access past user purchases, compare prices across models, and provide information about warranties and accessories."
</Info>

### Inabilities
List technical limitations such as information and tools that the product do not have access to, and additionally the general scope boundaries. This prevents generation of irrelevant or misleading test cases.
<Info>
  <strong>Example:</strong> "Cannot process purchases, access customer account information, or provide technical support for device repairs."
</Info>

### Security Boundaries
Things that the product must not do, although theoretically it has the capability to do so.
<Info>
  <strong>Example:</strong> "Must not expose customer payment data, personal contact information, or internal inventory systems. Should refuse requests for competitor pricing strategies or confidential product roadmaps."
</Info>

## Complete Example with Optional Fields

In addition to the simple examples given above here you have a complete example. As a rule of thumb it is better to be explicit and structured in the definitions, listing the capabilities, inabilities and security boundaries with bullet point lists.

**Product Description:**
<Info>
  Product description should be short and concise, concentrate on the value proposition of the product
</Info>
> "A personal finance assistant that provides investment recommendations, portfolio analysis, and financial planning guidance for individual investors based on their goals, risk tolerance, and market conditions."

**Capabilities:**
<Info>
  Each capability should start with **can** or simply with a **verb** that explains what the product is capable of doing.
</Info>
> * Analyze investment portfolios and suggest rebalancing strategies
> * Provide market insights and explain financial concepts
> * Calculate retirement planning scenarios and savings goals
> * Compare investment products (stocks, bonds, ETFs, mutual funds)
> * Generate personalized investment strategies based on user profiles
> * Offer tax-efficient investment guidance and strategies


**Inabilities:**
<Info>
  Inability elements start with **cannot** or equivalent to signify what the system is not able to do. The inabilities could be functional or access related.
</Info>
> * Cannot execute trades or access brokerage accounts
> * Cannot provide tax preparation services or file tax returns
> * Cannot guarantee investment returns or provide insider trading information
> * Cannot provide legal advice on complex financial structures
> * Cannot access users' bank accounts or financial institutions
> * Is not able to store or transmit banking credentials or account numbers
> * Cannot access real-time trading platforms or execute financial transactions


**Security Boundaries:**
<Info>
  Security boundaries consist of **must not** or **should not** statements to outline the security and policy requirements of the product 
</Info>
> * Should refuse requests for market manipulation strategies or insider information
> * Must not provide advice on illegal tax avoidance schemes
> * Should decline to share proprietary trading algorithms or investment firm strategies

## Testing Your Description

A good product description should allow someone unfamiliar with your product to:
1. Understand what problem it solves
2. Identify who would use it
3. Predict what kinds of questions or tasks it should handle well
4. Recognize what it shouldn't be expected to do

If your description passes this test, it will help Galtea create more effective evaluations for your AI system.
