The Test Service in the Galtea SDK allows you to manage [test-cases](/concepts/product/test/case) for evaluating your products.
This Service is exposed by the `galtea.tests` object and we will further explore its API down below.

<Info>
  Remember that we will be using the `galtea` object. More information [here](/sdk/api/galtea).
