## Returns
Returns a [Test](/concepts/product/test) object for the given parameters.

## Example
```python
test = galtea.tests.create(
    name="example-test-tutorial",
    type="QUALITY",
    product_id="YOUR_PRODUCT_ID",
    ground_truth_file_path="path/to/knowledge_file.pdf",
    language='english',
    variants=["paraphrased", "typos", "incorrect"],
    max_test_cases=100
)
```
<Info>
  See a complete example of creating **custom tests** in our [Create a Custom Test example](/sdk/examples/create-test).
</Info>

## Parameters
<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
  The name of the test.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="type" type="string" required>
  The type of test (e.g., [QUALITY](/concepts/product/test/quality-tests), [RED_TEAMING](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-tests)).
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="product_id" type="string" required>
  The ID of the product you want to evaluate.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="ground_truth_file_path" type="string" optional>
  Path to a local file (e.g., PDF, TXT, JSON, HTML, Markdown) containing the knowledge base. This file is uploaded to Galtea, which then generates test cases based on its content.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="few_shot_examples" type="string" optional>
  Optional few-shot examples to provide more context to our system about how the test cases should be generated. This can help our system better understand the expected format and style wanted for the test cases.
  **Example**: 
  ```
  Q: What is the capital of France? The capital of France is Paris.
  A: The capital of France is Paris.
  Q: What is the largest mammal?
  A: The largest mammal is the blue whale.
  ```
  <Note>This field only applies if tests are generated by Galtea and are of type `QUALITY`.</Note>
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="language" type="string" optional>
  The language for generating synthetic test cases if `ground_truth_file_path` is provided. Defaults to the language detected in the ground truth file. If provided, it should be written in English and be a valid language name from the ISO 639 standard (e.g., "english", "spanish", "french"). More information can be found at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes).
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="variants" type="list[string]" optional>
  List of variant types to generate for each test case from the `ground_truth_file_path`. For details on variants for Quality tests, see [Quality Test Evolutions](/concepts/product/test/quality-evolutions). Example: `["paraphrased", "typos", "incorrect", "cognitively_diverse", "linguistic_diverse"]`.
  For Red Teaming tests, the `variants` parameter can be used to specify which [threat categories](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-threats) to generate test cases for.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="strategies" type="list[string]" optional>
  A list of [red teaming strategies](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-strategies) used when generating test cases for Red Teaming tests. Strategies are techniques for modifying or obfuscating prompts generated for each threat (as specified in `variants` for Red Teaming tests). This parameter applies only when `type` is `RED_TEAMING`.
  If specified, this list must include the 'original' strategy.
  Example: `["original", "base64", "leetspeak", "zero_width_insertion"]`.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="max_test_cases" type="int" optional>
  An optional integer to limit the maximum number of test cases generated by Galtea when `ground_truth_file_path` is used.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="test_file_path" type="string" optional>
  Path to a local CSV file containing predefined test cases. This file is uploaded to Galtea.
</ResponseField>
