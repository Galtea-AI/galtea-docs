The Evaluation Service in the Galtea SDK allows you to manage [evaluations](/concepts/product/evaluation) for assessing your products.
This Service is exposed by the `galtea.evaluations` object and we will further explore its API down below.

  Remember that we will be using the `galtea` object. More information [here](/sdk/api/galtea).
