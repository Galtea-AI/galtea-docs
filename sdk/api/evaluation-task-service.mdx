The Evaluation Task Service in the Galtea SDK allows you to manage [evaluation tasks](/concepts/product/evaluation/task) for assessing your products.
This Service is exposed by the `galtea.evaluation_tasks` object and we will further explore its API down below.

<Info>
  Remember that we will be using the `galtea` object. More information [here](/sdk/api/galtea).

## Create Evaluation Task

This method allows you to create an evaluation task.

```python
evaluation_task = galtea.evaluation_tasks.create(
    evaluation_id="YOUR_EVALUATION_ID",
    metric_type="accuracy_v0",
    input="What is the capital of Spain?",
    actual_output="Barcelona",
    expected_output="Madrid"
)
```

<Info>
  See an example of running evaluation tasks in our [Run Evaluations example](/sdk/examples/create-evaluation).
