The Test Service in the Galtea SDK allows you to manage tests for evaluating your products.
This Service is exposed by the `galtea.tests` object and we will further explore its API down below.

Remember that we will be using the `galtea` object, which is an instance of the `Galtea` class.
```python
from galtea import Galtea
galtea = new Galtea(api_key="<YOUR_GALTEA_PLATFORM_API_KEY>")
```

- `product_id`
  - The ID of the product you want to evaluate.
- `ground_truth_file_path`
  - The path to the knowledge file (pdf format) in which We will find the information the source of truth for the model answers.
  - We have to wait for the platform to generate a syntehtic dataset based on the ground_truth provided, so we need to wait for the test to be ready before we can use it.
