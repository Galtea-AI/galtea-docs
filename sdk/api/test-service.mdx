The Test Service in the Galtea SDK allows you to manage [tests](/concepts/product/test) for evaluating your products.
This Service is exposed by the `galtea.tests` object and we will further explore its API down below.

<Info>
  Remember that we will be using the `galtea` object. More information [here](/sdk/api/galtea).
</Info>

## Create Test

This method allows you to create a test for your product.

```python
test = galtea.tests.create(
    name="example-test-tutorial",
    type="QUALITY",
    product_id="YOUR_PRODUCT_ID",
    test_file_path="tutorial_tests.csv"
)
```

<Info>
  See a complete example of creating tests in our [Create Custom Test example](/sdk/examples/create-test).
</Info>

<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
  The name of the test.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="type" type="string" required>
  The type of test (e.g., [QUALITY](/concepts/product/test/quality-tests), [RED_TEAMING](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-tests)).
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="product_id" type="string" required>
  The ID of the product you want to evaluate.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="ground_truth_file_path" type="string">
  The path to the knowledge file (pdf format) in which We will find the information the source of truth for the model answers.
  We have to wait for the platform to generate a synthetic dataset based on the ground_truth provided, so we need to wait for the test to be ready before we can use it.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="test_file_path" type="string">
  The path to the custom test file.
  This file should contain the test cases you want to evaluate.
</ResponseField>

## Listing Tests

This method allows you to list all tests associated with a specific product.

```python
tests = galtea.tests.list(product_id="YOUR_PRODUCT_ID")
```

<ResponseField name="product_id" type="string" required>
  The ID of the product for which you want to list tests.
</ResponseField>

## Retrieving Test

This method allows you to retrieve a specific test by its ID.

```python
test = galtea.tests.get(test_id="YOUR_TEST_ID")
```

<ResponseField name="test_id" type="string" required>
  The ID of the test you want to retrieve.
</ResponseField>

## Deleting Test

This method allows you to delete a specific test by its ID.

```python
galtea.tests.delete(test_id="YOUR_TEST_ID")
```

<ResponseField name="test_id" type="string" required>
