## Product Service

The Product Service in the Galtea SDK allows you to manage products that you want to evaluate. Below are some examples of how to use the Product Service.

### Creating a Product

```python
product = galtea.products.create(
    name="Document Summarizer",
    description="An AI tool that generates concise summaries of legal documents while preserving key information."
)
print(product.id)
```

### Listing Products

```python
products = galtea.products.list()
for product in products:
    print(product.name, product.id)
```

### Retrieving a Product

```python
product = galtea.products.get(product_id="YOUR_PRODUCT_ID")
print(product.name, product.description)
```

### Updating a Product

```python
updated_product = galtea.products.update(
    product_id="YOUR_PRODUCT_ID",
    name="Updated Product Name",
    optional_props={"description": "Updated product description"}
)
print(updated_product.name, updated_product.description)
```

### Deleting a Product

```python
galtea.products.delete(product_id="YOUR_PRODUCT_ID")
print("Product deleted successfully")
```
