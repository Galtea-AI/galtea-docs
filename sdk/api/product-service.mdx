The Product Service in the Galtea SDK allows you to manage [products](/concepts/product) that you want to evaluate.
This Service is exposed by the `galtea.products` object and we will further explore its API down below.

<Info>
  Remember that we will be using the `galtea` object. More information [here](/sdk/api/galtea).
</Info>

<Note>
  It is not supported to create product from the sdk, therefore you need to do this from the [platform](https://platform.galtea.ai/products).
