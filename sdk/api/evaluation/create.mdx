title: 'Create Evaluations'
description: "Create evaluations for all inference results within a session using specified metrics."
---

This method evaluates an entire conversation stored in a [Session](/concepts/product/version/session) by creating evaluations for each of its [Inference Results](/concepts/product/version/session/inference-result).

## Returns
Returns a list of [Evaluation](/concepts/product/version/session/evaluation) objects, one for each metric and each inference result in the session.


## Example
```python
# First, create a session and log inference results
session = galtea.sessions.create(version_id="YOUR_VERSION_ID")
galtea.inference_results.create_batch(
    session_id=session.id,
    conversation_turns=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hi"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hello!"},
        {"role": "user", "content": "How are you?"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "I am fine, thank you."}
    ]
)

# Now, evaluate the entire session
evaluations = galtea.evaluations.create(
    session_id=session.id,
    metrics=["Role Adherence", "Conversation Relevancy"]
)
```

<Warning>
  This method does not support `CustomScoreEvaluationMetric` objects. Attempting to use a custom metric will result in a `ValueError`. For custom scoring, please use the `create_single_turn` method for each turn of the conversation.
</Warning>

## Parameters
<ResponseField name="session_id" type="string" required>
  The ID of the session containing the inference results to be evaluated.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="metrics" type="List[string]" optional>
  A list of standard metrics to use, specified by name. It is not possible to use metrics with custom scores with this method.
  <Note>Either `metrics` or `metric_ids` must be provided.</Note>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="metric_ids" type="List[string]" optional>
  A list of metric IDs to use for the evaluation. This can be used as an alternative to the `metrics` parameter.
</ResponseField>
