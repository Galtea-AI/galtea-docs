The Version Service in the Galtea SDK allows you to manage different iterations of your [products](/concepts/product).
This Service is exposed by the `galtea.versions` object and we will further explore its API down below.

  Remember that we will be using the `galtea` object. More information [here](/sdk/api/galtea).
