---

The Product Service in the Galtea SDK allows you to manage [products](/concepts/product) that you want to evaluate.
This Service is exposed by the `galtea.products` object.

<Info>
  Remember that we will be using the `galtea` object. More information [here](/sdk/api/galtea).
</Info>

<Note>
  It is not supported to create product from the sdk, therefore you need to do this from the [dashboard](https://platform.galtea.ai/).
</Note>

## SDK Methods
- [Listing Products](/sdk/api/product/list)
- [Retrieving Product](/sdk/api/product/get)
- [Retrieving Product By Name](/sdk/api/product/get-by-name)
- [Deleting Product](/sdk/api/product/delete)
