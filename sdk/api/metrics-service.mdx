The Metrics Service in the Galtea SDK allows you to manage [metric types](/concepts/metric-type) for evaluating your products.
This Service is exposed by the `galtea.metrics` object and we will further explore its API down below.

<Info>
  Remember that we will be using the `galtea` object. More information [here](/sdk/api/galtea).

## Create Metric

This method allows you to create a metric.

```python
metric = galtea.metrics.create(
    name="accuracy_v1",
    criteria="Determine whether the actual output is equivalent to the expected output."
    evaluation_params=["input", "expected output", "actual output"],
)
```

<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
  The name of the metric.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="evaluation_params" type="list[string]" required>
  A list of strings indicating which parameters are relevant for this metric's evaluation criteria or steps. The SDK expects these as strings (e.g., 'actual output'). Provide at least 'input' and one other parameter. Possible values are:
  - **input**: The prompt or query sent to the model. (Always required).
  - **actual output**: The actual output generated by the model.
  - **expected output**: The ideal answer for the given input.
  - **context**: Additional background information provided to the model alongside the input.
  - **retrieval context**: The context retrieved by your RAG system.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="criteria" type="string" required="conditional">
  The criteria for the metric.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="evaluation_steps" type="list[string]" required="conditional">
  The evaluation steps for the metric.
  <Note>
    You need to provide **either** *Criteria* **or** *Evaluation Steps*, but not both. Your choice depends on your preferred evaluation approach.
  </Note>
</ResponseField>



## Listing Metrics

This method allows you to list all metrics.

```python
metrics = galtea.metrics.list()
```

<ResponseField name="offset" type="int">
  The number of metrics to skip before starting to collect the result set.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="limit" type="int">
  The maximum number of metrics to return.
</ResponseField>

## Retrieving Metric

This method allows you to retrieve a specific metric by its ID.

```python
metric = galtea.metrics.get(metric_type_id="YOUR_METRIC_ID")
```

<ResponseField name="metric_type_id" type="string" required>
  The ID of the metric you want to retrieve.
</ResponseField>

## Retrieving Metric By Name
This method allows you to retrieve a specific metric by its name.

```python
metric = galtea.metrics.get_by_name(name="YOUR_METRIC_NAME")
```
<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
  The name of the metric you want to retrieve.
</ResponseField>

## Deleting Metric

This method allows you to delete a specific metric by its ID.

```python
galtea.metrics.delete(metric_type_id="YOUR_METRIC_ID")
```

<ResponseField name="metric_type_id" type="string" required>
  The ID of the metric you want to delete.
</ResponseField>
