The Metrics Service in the Galtea SDK allows you to manage [metric types](/concepts/metric-type) for evaluating your products.
This Service is exposed by the `galtea.metrics` object and we will further explore its API down below.

<Info>
  Remember that we will be using the `galtea` object. More information [here](/sdk/api/galtea).

## Create Metric

This method allows you to create a metric.

```python

```

<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
  The name of the metric.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="criteria" type="string" required>

## Listing Metrics

This method allows you to list all metrics.

```python
metrics = galtea.metrics.list()
```

<ResponseField name="offset" type="int">
  The number of metrics to skip before starting to collect the result set.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="limit" type="int">
  The maximum number of metrics to return.
</ResponseField>

## Retrieving Metric

This method allows you to retrieve a specific metric by its ID.

```python
metric = galtea.metrics.get(metric_id="YOUR_METRIC_ID")
```

<ResponseField name="metric_id" type="string" required>
  The ID of the metric you want to retrieve.
</ResponseField>

## Deleting Metric

This method allows you to delete a specific metric by its ID.
