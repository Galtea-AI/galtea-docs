# Migrating to Galtea SDK v3.0

Welcome to Galtea SDK v3.0! This version introduces major improvements, including a new session-based evaluation workflow and simplifications to the existing test-based workflow.

This guide will walk you through the necessary changes to update your SDK v2.x integrations and introduce you to the new features available in v3.0.

## Part 1: Migrating Your Existing Workflow (Test-Case-Based Evaluation)

The core workflow for running predefined tests against a version has been streamlined.

### Key Changes for Test-Based Evaluations

1. **New Terminology**: The old `EvaluationTask` entity is now simply called `Evaluation`. The concept of a parent `Evaluation` container has been removed to simplify the workflow.

2. **Simplified Workflow**: The previous two-step process of creating an `Evaluation` container and then adding `EvaluationTask`s to it is now a single method call.

3. **New Method `create_single_turn()`**: The old methods for creating tasks (e.g., `galtea.evaluation_tasks.create()`) are replaced by `galtea.evaluations.create_single_turn()`. This new method directly creates evaluations without needing a pre-existing container.

4. **Updated Parameters**: The `create_single_turn()` method now requires a `version_id` instead of an `evaluation_id`, as the direct link is now to the version being tested.

5. **Simplified Version Creation**: The `galtea.versions.create()` method now accepts all properties as direct keyword arguments, removing the need for the `optional_props` dictionary.

6. **Added Sessions**: The new `galtea.sessions.create()` method allows you to create sessions to group multiple inference results (conversation turns) under a single session, making it easier to track multi-turn interactions.

### Migration Diff: Test-Case Workflow

Here's a side-by-side comparison of a typical v2 script and its direct v3 equivalent.

#### ❌ SDK v2.x (Old Way)
```python
from galtea import Galtea
galtea = Galtea(api_key="...")

# 1. Create version with optional_props dictionary
version = galtea.versions.create(
    name="v2.0-summarizer",
    product_id="YOUR_PRODUCT_ID",
    optional_props={
      "description": "Old version using gpt-3.5",
      "model_id": "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    }
)

# 2. In v2, you first created an "Evaluation" container
evaluation_container = galtea.evaluations.create(
    test_id="YOUR_TEST_ID",
    version_id=version.id
)

# 3. Then, you created individual "EvaluationTasks" inside it
galtea.evaluation_tasks.create(
    evaluation_id=evaluation_container.id,
    test_case_id="YOUR_TEST_CASE_ID",
    metrics=["your_metric"],
    actual_output="This is the model's output."
)
```

#### ✅ SDK v3.0 (New Way)
```python
from galtea import Galtea
galtea = Galtea(api_key="...")

# 1. Create version with direct keyword arguments
version = galtea.versions.create(
    name="v3.0-summarizer",
    product_id="YOUR_PRODUCT_ID",
    description="New version using gpt-4",
    model_id="gpt-4"
)

# 2. Skip explicit evaluation creation (it's automatic!)

# 3. Create evaluations using version_id
galtea.evaluations.create_single_turn(
    version_id=version.id,
    test_case_id="YOUR_TEST_CASE_ID",
    metrics=["your_metric"],
    actual_output="This is the model's output."
)
```

<Note>
    This example demonstrates how to create single-turn evaluations for test cases. For production data logging, include the `input` parameter and set `is_production=True`. If you want to evaluate multi-turn conversations, refer to the new session-based workflow in Part 2.
</Note>

### Production Data Logging with Single-Turn Evaluations

For production monitoring, you can also use `create_single_turn()` without a test case:

```python
# Production data logging (no test case required)
galtea.evaluations.create_single_turn(
    version_id=version.id,
    input="User's actual input",
    actual_output="Model's actual output",
    metrics=["your_metric"],
    is_production=True
)
```

### Summary of Actions for Migration

1. In `galtea.versions.create()` calls, remove the `optional_props` dictionary and pass its contents as direct keyword arguments.
2. **Remove** all calls to `galtea.evaluations.create()` that were used to create evaluation containers.
3. Rename `galtea.evaluation_tasks.create()` calls to `galtea.evaluations.create_single_turn()`, **remove** the `evaluation_id` parameter, and **add** the `version_id` parameter.

<Note>
    Ensure all your code, including any examples you may be referencing from the SDK repository, is updated. The `optional_props` dictionary is fully deprecated in v3.0, and some examples in the codebase may not yet reflect the v3.0 changes.
</Note>

## Part 2: What's New in v3.0 - The Session-Based Workflow

SDK v3.0 introduces a powerful new way to log and evaluate multi-turn conversations through **Sessions** and **Inference Results**. This approach is ideal for monitoring production traffic or evaluating complex, interactive scenarios.

### New Concepts

* **Session**: A container for a sequence of interactions (a conversation) between a user and your AI product. You can create a session using `galtea.sessions.create()`.
* **Inference Result**: A single turn within a session, containing the `input` and `output`. You log these using `galtea.inference_results.create()`.
* **`evaluations.create()`**: A new way to run evaluations on all inference results within a given session. This allows for easy batch evaluation of entire conversations.

### Example of the New Session-Based Workflow

This workflow is entirely new and does not directly replace the test-based workflow.

```python
# SDK v3.0 New Workflow Example
from galtea import Galtea

galtea = Galtea(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

YOUR_PRODUCT_ID = "your_product_id"
YOUR_VERSION_ID = "your_version_id"
YOUR_TEST_CASE_ID = "your_test_case_id"
YOUR_METRIC_NAME = "your_metric_name"

# 1. Create a Session to group a conversation
session = galtea.sessions.create(
    version_id=YOUR_VERSION_ID,
    test_case_id=YOUR_TEST_CASE_ID,
)
print(f"Created Session: {session.id}")

# 2. Log all inference results in a single efficient batch call
conversation_turns = [
    {
        "input": "What's your return policy?",
        "output": "Our return policy allows returns within 30 days of purchase."
    },
    {
        "input": "What if I lost the receipt?",
        "output": "A proof of purchase is required for all returns."
    },
    {
        "input": "Can I return items bought online to a physical store?",
        "output": "Yes, you can return online purchases to any of our physical store locations."
    },
    {
        "input": "What about exchanges?",
        "output": "Exchanges follow the same 30-day policy and can be done in-store or online."
    }
]

# Use create_batch for efficient bulk processing
galtea.inference_results.create_batch(
    session_id=session.id,
    conversation_turns=conversation_turns
)

print(f"Stored {len(conversation_turns)} inference results in session {session.id} with a single call")

# Or loop through conversation turns
# for turn in conversation_turns:
#     galtea.inference_results.create(
#         session_id=session.id,
#         input=turn["input"],
#         output=turn["output"]
#     )

# 3. When ready, create evaluations for the entire session
evaluations = galtea.evaluations.create(
    session_id=session.id,
    metrics=[YOUR_METRIC_NAME]
)
print(f"Submitted {len(evaluations)} evaluations for session {session.id}")
```

<Note>
    For better performance with multiple conversation turns, always use `create_batch()` instead of calling `create()` in a loop. This reduces network overhead and improves response times.
</Note>

### Benefits of the New Workflow

* **Track Full Conversations**: Accurately log and analyze multi-turn user interactions.
* **Production Monitoring**: Easily send production data to Galtea for continuous evaluation by removing the `test_case_id` parameter when creating sessions and adding `is_production=True`.
* **Batch Evaluation**: Evaluate an entire conversation with a single command.
