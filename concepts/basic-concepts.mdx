## Overview

Galtea enables organizations to assess their products using LLM-as-a-judge technologies. Evaluations can be conducted on any output based on custom criteria, resulting in a set of Galtea-predefined and user-defined metrics.

## Platform Access

You can interact with Galtea through multiple channels:

## Core Concepts

Galtea is built around several key concepts that work together to provide comprehensive evaluation of AI products:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Product" icon="box" iconType="solid" href="/concepts/product">
    A functionality or service being evaluated
  </Card>
  <Card title="Version" icon="swatchbook" iconType="solid" href="/concepts/product/version">
    A specific iteration of a product
  </Card>
  <Card title="Test" icon="clipboard-list" iconType="solid" href="/concepts/product/test">
    A set of challenges for evaluating product performance
  </Card>
  <Card title="Evaluation" icon="badge-check" iconType="solid" href="/concepts/product/evaluation">
    A link between a product version and a test
  </Card>
  <Card title="Metric Type" icon="function" iconType="solid" href="/concepts/metric-type">
    Ways to evaluate and score product performance
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Evaluation Workflow

The typical workflow in Galtea follows these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Product">Create a [Product](/concepts/product) to represent your AI functionality</Step>
  <Step title="Create Version">Define a new [Version](/concepts/product/version) of your [Product](/concepts/product) with specific parameters</Step>
  <Step title="Create Test">Define a new [Test](/concepts/product/test) with challenges to evaluate your [Product](/concepts/product)</Step>
  <Step title="Run Evaluations">Test the [Version](/concepts/product/version) against one [Test](/concepts/product/test) using [Evaluations](/concepts/product/evaluation) and custom [Metric Types](/concepts/metric-type)</Step>
  <Step title="Analyze Results">Review and compare the performance of different [Versions](/concepts/product/version) using the built-in analytics</Step>
  <Step title="Iterate">Create new [Version](/concepts/product/version) with improvements and repeat the evaluation process</Step>
</Steps>
