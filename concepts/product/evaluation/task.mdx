## What is an Evaluation Task?

An evaluation task in Galtea represents the assessment of a single [test case](/concepts/product/test/case) from a [test](/concepts/product/test) using a specific [evaluation criteria](/concepts/metric-type). Multiple evaluation tasks make up an [evaluation](/concepts/product/evaluation).

<Note>Evaluation tasks don't perform inference on the LLM product themselves. Rather, they evaluate outputs that have already been generated. You should perform inference on your product first, then trigger the evaluation task with both the input (provided by the test case) and the resulting output.</Note>

## Task Lifecycle

Evaluation tasks follow a specific lifecycle:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Inference">Perform inference on the LLM product to generate an output using the test case's input and context</Step>
  <Step title="Creation">[Trigger an evaluation task](/sdk/examples/create-evaluation). It will appear in the Evaluation's details page with the status "pending"</Step>
  <Step title="Processing">Galtea's evaluation system processes the task using evaluation criteria of the selected metric type</Step>
  <Step title="Completion">Once processed, the status changes to "completed" and the [results](#task-results-properties) are available</Step>
</Steps>

## Task Creation Properties

To trigger an evaluation task in Galtea, you'll need to provide the following information:

<ResponseField name="Evaluation" type="ID (text)" required>
  The unique identifier of the evaluation that the task is part of.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Test Case" type="ID (text)" required>
  The unique identifier of the test case to be evaluated.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Actual Output" type="String" required>
  The actual output produced by the product's version. **Example**: "The iPhone 16 costs $950."
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Metric Type" type="ID (text)" required>
  The unique identifier of the metric type to be used in the evaluation task.
  <Info>The SDK allows you to use the metric type's name instead of the ID.</Info>
</ResponseField>
## Task Results Properties

Once an evaluation task is completed, you can access the following information:

<ResponseField name="Status" type="Enum">
  The current status of the evaluation task.asd
  Possible values:
  - **Pending**: The task has been created but not yet processed.
  - **Success**: The task was processed successfully.
  - **Failed**: The task encountered an error during processing.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Score" type="Number">
  The score assigned to the output by the metric type's evaluation criteria. **Example**: 0.85
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Reason" type="Text">
  The explanation of the score assigned to the output by the [metric type's](/concepts/metric-type) evaluation criteria.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Error" type="Text">
  The error message if the task failed during processing.
</ResponseField>
