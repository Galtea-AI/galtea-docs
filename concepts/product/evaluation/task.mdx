## What is an Evaluation Task?

An evaluation task in Galtea represents the assessment of a single challenge from a [test](/concepts/product/test) using a specific [metric type's](/concepts/metric-type) evaluation criteria. Multiple evaluation tasks make up an [evaluation](/concepts/product/evaluation).

<Note>Evaluation tasks don't perform inference on the LLM product themselves. Rather, they evaluate outputs that have already been generated. You should perform inference on your product first, then trigger the evaluation task with both the input and the resulting output.</Note>

## Task Lifecycle

Evaluation tasks follow a specific lifecycle:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Creation">When you trigger an evaluation task, it appears in the Evaluation's details page with a status of "pending"</Step>
  <Step title="Processing">Galtea's evaluation system processes the task using evaluation criteria of the selected metric type</Step>
  <Step title="Completion">Once processed, the status changes to "completed" and the result (score) is available</Step>
</Steps>

## Task Properties

To trigger an evaluation task in Galtea, you'll need to provide the following information:

<ResponseField name="Evaluation" type="ID (text)" required>
  The unique identifier of the evaluation that the task is part of.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Metric Type" type="ID (text)" required>
  The unique identifier of the metric type to be used in the evaluation task.
  <Info>The SDK allows you to use the metric type's name instead of the ID.</Info>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Input" type="String" required>
  The input data used for inference on the LLM product's version. **Example**: "How much does the iPhone 16 cost?"
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Actual Output" type="String" required>
  The actual output produced by the product's version. **Example**: "The iPhone 16 costs $950."
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Expected Output" type="String">
  The expected output for the evaluation task, extracted from the test file. **Example**: "The iPhone 16 costs $999."
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Context" type="String">
  Additional context provided to the product's version upon inference. **Example**: "[product catalog]"
</ResponseField>
