title: "Conversation Relevancy"
description: "Checks if your product consistently responds in a contextually relevant way during a multi-turn conversation."
---

The **Conversation Relevancy** metric evaluates your LLM-based chatbot’s ability to generate contextually appropriate and relevant responses across the course of a multi-turn dialogue. It assesses whether each response aligns with the user’s intent, prior inputs, and the evolving context of the conversation.

This metric is particularly useful for ensuring coherent, on-topic conversations that maintain engagement and avoid misunderstandings or irrelevant diversions.

## Evaluation Parameters

To compute the `conversation_relevancy` metric, the following parameters are required:

- **`input`**: The most recent user message in the conversation.
- **`actual_output`**: The chatbot’s corresponding response.
- **`conversational_turns`**: The complete history of the conversation up to the current exchange.

These inputs enable the metric to evaluate the relevance of the response in context, not just in isolation.

## How Is It Calculated?

The `conversation_relevancy` score is derived using an LLM-as-a-judge approach:

1. **Contextual Analysis**: An LLM is used to analyze the full `conversational_turns`, including the current `input` and `actual_output`.
2. **Relevancy Judgment**: The LLM determines whether the `actual_output` directly addresses the user's intent and fits naturally within the flow of the dialogue.

The score is based on the ratio of contextually relevant responses to the total number of evaluated responses:

$$
\text{Conversation Relevancy} = \frac{\text{Number of relevant responses}}{\text{Total number of evaluated turns}}
$$

Scores range from **0** (entirely off-topic) to **1** (fully relevant throughout), helping you monitor and improve conversational quality at scale.
