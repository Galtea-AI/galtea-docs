## What is a Session?

A session in Galtea is a container for a sequence of interactions that form a complete conversation between a user and an AI product. It groups together multiple [inference results](/concepts/product/version/session/inference-result), allowing for the evaluation of multi-turn dialogues and the analysis of production data.

You can **create**, view and manage your sessions programmatically using the [Galtea SDK](/sdk/api/session/service).

## SDK Integration

The Galtea SDK allows you to create, view, and manage sessions programmatically. This is particularly useful for logging production data or for evaluating complex conversational flows.
