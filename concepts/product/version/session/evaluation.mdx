## What is an Evaluation?

An evaluation in Galtea is a group of [Inference Results](/concepts/product/version/session/inference-result) from a particular [session](/concepts/product/version/session). It serves as the container for all the [evaluation tasks](/concepts/product/version/session/evaluation/task) that assess how well the product version performs.

## Evaluation Tasks

The core components of an evaluation are its [evaluation tasks](/concepts/product/version/session/evaluation/task). Each task represents the assessment of the evaluation using a specific [metric type](/concepts/metric-type).

<Note>
  An evaluation is **created implicitly** when you create an [evaluation task](/concepts/product/version/session/evaluation/task) for a specific [session](/concepts/product/version/session). In this case, the evaluation will be linked to all [Inference Results](/concepts/product/version/session/inference-result) from that session.

## Results Visualization

Once you've created an evaluation, you can access detailed information and results on the [dashboard](https://platform.galtea.ai/).

<Info>
  To view evaluation results, you need to visit a product's *Analytics* section. For detailed information about a particular evaluation, you can navigate to the *Evaluation Tasks* tab.
</Info>

The platform provides:
- Overview of a product's evaluation results per metric
- Analytics comparing different versions of the product
- Detailed view of individual evaluation tasks

## SDK Integration

The Galtea SDK allows you to view and manage evaluations programmatically. This is particularly useful for organizations that want to automate their evaluation process or integrate it into their CI/CD pipeline.
