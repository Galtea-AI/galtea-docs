## What is a Session?

A session in Galtea is a container for a sequence of interactions that form a complete conversation between a user and an AI product. It groups together multiple [inference results](//concepts/product/inference-result), allowing for the evaluation of multi-turn dialogues and the analysis of production data.

You can **create**, view and manage your sessions programmatically using the [Galtea SDK](/sdk/api/session/service).

## Use Cases for Sessions

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Evaluate Conversations" icon="comments">
    Assess how well your model maintains context and coherence over multiple turns.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Monitor Production Data" icon="chart-line">
    Log real-world user interactions for continuous monitoring and analysis.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Debug Complex Interactions" icon="bug">
    Trace the full history of a conversation to identify where and why a model failed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Batch Evaluations" icon="layer-group">
    Run evaluations on an entire conversation's worth of inference results with a single command.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## SDK Integration

The Galtea SDK allows you to create, view, and manage sessions programmatically. This is particularly useful for logging production data or for evaluating complex conversational flows.
