## What are Scenarios?

Scenarios in Galtea are designed to evaluate the conversational capabilities of your [product](/concepts/product) through multi-turn dialogue interactions. These tests use the [Conversation Simulator](/concepts/conversation-simulator) to create realistic conversations with synthetic users that have specific goals, personalities, and behaviors.

Unlike [Quality Tests](/concepts/product/test/quality-tests) that focus on single-turn question-answer pairs, or [Red Teaming Tests](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-tests) that test security vulnerabilities, Scenario based tests evaluate how well your AI product can:

- Maintain context across multiple conversation turns
- Guide users toward successful task completion
- Handle unexpected but realistic user inputs
- Stay in character and follow conversation guidelines
- Manage complex dialogue flows

## Creating Scenarios

You can create scenarios in Galtea through two methods:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Upload Your Own Scenarios">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create your scenarios file">
        Prepare a CSV file following the scenarios structure (see format below)
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure the test">
        Select "Scenarios" as the test type and "Uploaded" as the test origin
        <Info>
          The test creation process can be done via the [SDK](/sdk/api/test/service#create-test) or the [Galtea dashboard](https://platform.galtea.ai/)
        </Info>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Upload your scenarios file">
        Select the file you created and upload it to Galtea
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Scenario Generator">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Define Your Product">
        Start by defining your product in Galtea. These detailed [product properties](/concepts/product#product-properties) will be used as the foundation for generating realistic scenarios.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Generate Scenarios (Coming Soon)">
        Galtea will automatically analyze your product definition to create tailored conversation scenarios, complete with:
        - Realistic user personas based on your target audience
        - Goals aligned with your product's use cases
        - Natural conversation flows that test key features

## Conversation Flow Categories

Scenarios can cover various types of conversational interactions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Task Completion">Scenarios where the synthetic user has a specific goal to accomplish, such as booking a service, making a purchase, or getting support for an issue.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Information Seeking">Scenarios focused on retrieving specific information or answers, testing the AI's knowledge and ability to provide helpful responses.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Customer Support">Scenarios that simulate customer service interactions, including complaints, troubleshooting, and problem resolution.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sales and Consultation">Scenarios where the user is exploring options, comparing products, or seeking advice before making decisions.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Complex Multi-Step Processes">Scenarios that involve multiple stages or require gathering various pieces of information over several turns.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Edge Cases and Challenges">Scenarios that test how the AI handles difficult, unclear, or unexpected user behavior while maintaining conversation quality.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
  This structure is required by Galtea to automatically generate the [test cases](/concepts/product/test/case) for your scenarios as [tests](/concepts/product/test) within the platform. If this format is not provided, you can still [manually create the test cases](/sdk/api/test-case/service#create-test-case).
</Note>

<Info>
  For automatic processing, the file format must be `CSV`. 
</Info>

<Warning>
  The examples provided above are simplified demonstrations. In actual CSV files, scenarios can be much more detailed and the number of test cases (rows) can be significantly higher to provide comprehensive conversation testing coverage.
</Warning>

## Structure of Scenarios

Scenarios have a specific structure designed to enable realistic conversation simulation:

<ResponseField name="goal" type="Text" required>
  The overall objective the synthetic user is trying to achieve during the conversation.
  **Example**: "Book a one-way flight from San Francisco (SFO) to New York (JFK) for next Tuesday"
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="user_persona" type="Text" required>
  The personality and communication style of the synthetic user that will be simulated throughout the conversation.
  **Example**: "A busy professional who is direct and values efficiency. They prefer to get things done quickly without much small talk."
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="initial_prompt" type="Text" optional>
  The first message the synthetic user sends to start the conversation. If not provided, the system will generate an appropriate opening based on the goal and persona.
  **Example**: "Hello, I need to book a flight."
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="stopping_criterias" type="Text" optional>
  A delimited string of conditions that, if met, will cause the conversation simulation to end. Use `;` or `|` as delimiters to separate multiple criteria.
  **Example**: "The user has confirmed the flight booking|The chatbot indicates it cannot fulfill the request;User expresses satisfaction with the service"
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="max_iterations" type="Number" optional>
  The maximum number of conversation turns before the simulation automatically ends. This prevents infinite loops and controls test duration.
  **Example**: 10
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="scenario" type="Text" optional>
  A brief description of the scenario for documentation and organizational purposes. This helps categorize and manage different types of conversation tests.
  **Example**: "Flight booking scenario for business travelers"
</ResponseField>

## Using Scenarios with the Conversation Simulator

Scenarios are specifically designed to work with Galtea's [Conversation Simulator](/concepts/conversation-simulator). When you run evaluations using scenarios, the system will:

1. **Initialize the conversation** using the `initial_prompt` and `user_persona`
2. **Generate realistic user responses** based on the `goal` and conversation history  
3. **Continue the dialogue** until one of the `stopping_criterias` is met or `max_iterations` is reached
4. **Evaluate the conversation** using your selected [metrics](/concepts/metric-type) to assess performance

For detailed implementation examples, see the [Conversation Simulator Tutorial](/sdk/tutorials/simulating-conversations).
