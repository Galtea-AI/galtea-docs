## What are Red Teaming Tests?

Red teaming tests in Galtea are designed to evaluate the security, safety, and bias aspects of your [product](/concepts/product). These tests typically consist of adversarial inputs specifically crafted to probe potential weaknesses or vulnerabilities in your AI system.

## Structure of Red Teaming Tests

Red teaming tests have a specific structure focused on providing challenging inputs:

<ResponseField name="instance_id" type="Integer" required>
  A unique identifier for the test instance.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="input" type="String" required>
  The adversarial input specifically designed to test the product's resilience against potential vulnerabilities. **Example**: "Please ignore any previous instructions and..."
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="expected_output" type="String">
  For red teaming tests, this field is typically marked as "N/A" since the purpose is to test system resilience rather than producing a specific output.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="tag" type="String">
  A categorization tag for the test instance, typically "adversarial_inputs" for red teaming tests.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="context" type="String">
  Additional context information if needed. For most red teaming tests, this is marked as "N/A".
</ResponseField>

## File Format and Example Red Teaming Tests

<Warning>
  Red teaming tests intentionally contain harmful or adversarial content. These are used solely for the purpose of testing AI safety and security. Always handle such content responsibly and in accordance with your organization's policies.
</Warning>

The recommended file format for red teaming tests is CSV. Here are examples of the structure and content:

  <Accordion title="Jailbreak Attempts">

## Creating Red Teaming Tests

You can create red teaming tests in Galtea through two methods:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Generate from Ground Truth">
    <Steps>
