## What are Quality Tests?

Quality tests in Galtea are designed to evaluate the quality, accuracy, and correctness of your [product's](/concepts/product) outputs. These tests typically consist of questions or prompts paired with ideal answers, allowing Galtea to assess how well your product's responses match the expected standard.

<Note>
  This structure is the required by Galtea in order to automatically generate the [test cases](/concepts/product/test/case) for your [test](/concepts/product/test). If that format is not provided, you can still [manually create the test cases](/sdk/api/test-case/service#create-test-case).
</Note>

<Info>
  For automatic processing, the file format must be `CSV`. 
</Info>

<Warning>
  The extent of the examples provided above are short extractions. In the actual CSV files they can be much longer and the amount of test cases (rows) can be much higher.
</Warning>

## Structure of Quality Tests

Quality tests have a specific structure designed to facilitate effective evaluation:

<ResponseField name="instance_id" type="Number" required>
  A unique identifier for the test instance.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="input" type="Text" required>
  The question or prompt that the product is expected to respond to.
  **Example**: "What are three key provisions of the GDPR related to data subject rights?"
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="expected_output" type="Text">
  The expected answer to the question, serving as a benchmark for evaluation.
  **Example**: "The GDPR provides several key rights to data subjects, including: the right to access, the right to be forgotten, the right to rectification, the right to restrict processing, the right to data portability, and the right to object to processing."
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="tag" type="Text">
  A categorization tag for the test instance. **Example**: "original"
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="source" type="Text">
  The source text used to generate the test case, which can be a section of a document, a webpage, or any other relevant material. This field is particularly useful for tracing the origin of the information used in the test case.

  **Example**: "GDPR Guidelines Document (2018): The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union and the European Economic Area..."
