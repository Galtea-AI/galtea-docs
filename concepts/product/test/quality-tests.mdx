## What are Quality Tests?

Quality tests in Galtea are designed to evaluate the quality, accuracy, and correctness of your [product's](/concepts/product) outputs. These tests typically consist of questions or prompts paired with ideal answers, allowing Galtea to assess how well your product's responses match the expected standard.

## Structure of Quality Tests

Quality tests have a specific structure designed to facilitate effective evaluation:

<ResponseField name="instance_id" type="Integer" required>
  A unique identifier for the test instance.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="input" type="String" required>
  The question or prompt that the product is expected to respond to.
  **Example**: "What are three key provisions of the GDPR related to data subject rights?"
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="expected_output" type="String" required>
  The expected answer to the question, serving as a benchmark for evaluation.
  **Example**: "The GDPR provides several key rights to data subjects, including: the right to access, the right to be forgotten, the right to rectification, the right to restrict processing, the right to data portability, and the right to object to processing."
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="tag" type="String">
  A categorization tag for the test instance. **Example**: "original"
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="context" type="String">
  Additional context information to help with answering the question.
  **Example**: "GDPR Guidelines Document (2018): The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union and the European Economic Area..."
</ResponseField>

## File Format and Example Quality Tests

The recommended file format for quality tests is CSV. Here are examples of the structure and content:

<Note>
  This structure is the same as that generated by Galtea's test generator for quality tests. If you're having Galtea generate tests from a ground truth file, this is the format you'll receive.

<Warning>
  The contexts and the extent of the examples provided above are short extractions. In the actual CSV files the context can be much longer and the amount of challenges can be much higher.
