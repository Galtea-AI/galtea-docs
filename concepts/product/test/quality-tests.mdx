## What are Quality Tests?

Quality tests in Galtea are designed to evaluate the quality, accuracy, and correctness of your [product's](/concepts/product) outputs. These tests typically consist of questions or prompts paired with ideal answers, allowing Galtea to assess how well your product's responses match the expected standard.

## Structure of Quality Tests

Quality tests have a specific structure designed to facilitate effective evaluation:

<ResponseField name="instance_id" type="Integer" required>
  A unique identifier for the test instance. **Example**: 0
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="input" type="String" required>
  The question or prompt that the product is expected to respond to.
  **Example**: "What are the key provisions of the GDPR related to data subject rights?"
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="expected_output" type="String" required>
  The expected answer to the question, serving as a benchmark for evaluation.
  **Example**: "The GDPR provides several key rights to data subjects, including: the right to access, the right to be forgotten, the right to rectification, the right to restrict processing, the right to data portability, and the right to object to processing."
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="tag" type="String" required>
  A categorization tag for the test instance. **Example**: "original"
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="context" type="String" optional>
  Additional context information to help with answering the question.
  **Example**: "Excerpt from GDPR Article 15-20 documentation..."
</ResponseField>

## File Format

The recommended file format for quality tests is JSON. Here's an example of the structure:

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "instance_id": 0,
      "input": "¿Cuál es el sistema operativo del Samsung Galaxy A8 EE?",
      "expected_output": "Android 8.1 + EMUI 8.1",
      "tag": "original",
      "context": "Noviembre 2018Catálogo \ndispositivos \nmóviles\nSamsung Galaxy A8 EE\n€/mes*11,49 Sistema Operativo : Android 8.0\nPantalla : 5.6 FHD+ (1080 x 2220) Super Amoled\nProcesador: Exynos7885 Octa Core (2.2 GHz Dual + 1.6 \nGHz Hexa)\nCámara: Principal 16 MP PDAF (F1.7) + Flash.

    },
    {
      "instance_id": 0,
      "input": "What is the Capital of France?",
      "expected_output": "Paris",
      "tag": "original"
    },
    {
      "instance_id": 1,
      "input": "What are three key provisions of the GDPR?",
      "tag": "original",
      "context": "GDPR Guidelines Document (2018): The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy in the European Union and the European Economic Area. It also addresses the transfer of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR aims primarily to give control to individuals over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU."
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>
  This structure is the same as that generated by Galtea's test generator for quality tests. If you're having Galtea generate tests from a ground truth file, this is the format you'll receive.
