## What are Quality Tests?

Quality tests in Galtea are designed to evaluate the quality, accuracy, and correctness of your [product's](/concepts/product) outputs. These tests typically consist of questions or prompts paired with ideal answers, allowing Galtea to assess how well your product's responses match the expected standard.

## Structure of Quality Tests

Quality tests have a specific structure designed to facilitate effective evaluation:

<ResponseField name="Question" type="String" required>
  The question or prompt that the product is expected to respond to. **Example**: "What are the key provisions of the GDPR related to data subject rights?"
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Ideal Answer" type="String" required>
  The expected answer to the question, serving as a benchmark for evaluation. **Example**: "The GDPR provides several key rights to data subjects, including: the right to access, the right to be forgotten, the right to rectification, the right to restrict processing, the right to data portability,
  and the right to object to processing."
</ResponseField>

## File Format

The recommended file format for quality tests is JSON. Here's an example of the structure:

```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "question": "What is the capital of France?",
      "ideal_answer": "Paris is the capital of France. It is located in the north-central part of the country on the Seine River."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are three key provisions of the GDPR?",
      "ideal_answer": "Three key provisions of the GDPR are: 1) The requirement for explicit consent before processing personal data, 2) The right of data subjects to access and delete their personal data, and 3) The requirement to report data breaches within 72 hours."
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>This structure is the same as that generated by Galtea's test generator for quality tests. If you're having Galtea generate tests from a ground truth file, this is the format you'll receive.</Note>

## Creating Quality Tests

You can create quality tests in Galtea through two methods:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Generate from Ground Truth">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Prepare your ground truth file">Create a file with question-answer pairs or a comprehensive document from which questions can be generated</Step>
      <Step title="Create a new test in Galtea">Select "Quality" as the test type and "Generated" as the test origin</Step>
      <Step title="Upload your ground truth file">Galtea will process this file and generate a set of test questions and ideal answers</Step>
      <Step title="Review and finalize">Review the generated test cases and make any necessary adjustments</Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Upload Your Own Test">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create your test file">Prepare a JSON file following the structure shown above</Step>
      <Step title="Create a new test in Galtea">Select "Quality" as the test type and "Uploaded" as the test origin</Step>
      <Step title="Upload your test file">Galtea will validate the format and structure of your file</Step>
      <Step title="Finalize">Complete the test creation process</Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Using Quality Tests in Evaluations

Once you've created a quality test, you can use it in [evaluations](/concepts/product/evaluation) to assess the performance of specific [versions](/concepts/product/version) of your product.

When evaluation tasks are executed, Galtea will compare your product's actual outputs to the ideal answers using the specified [metric types](/concepts/metric-type), providing scores and insights on quality dimensions.
