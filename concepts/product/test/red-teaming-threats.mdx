## What is a threat?

Red teaming tests are divided into different type of threats in order test the robustness of your product against different types of attack or misuse. These threats are derived from various cybersecurity frameworks specifically defined for LLM based products such as:

## Creating Red Teaming Tests

You can create red teaming tests in Galtea through two methods:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Generate from Knowledge Base">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Prepare your knowledge base file">
        Create a file with examples of harmful content or sensitive topic areas you want to test
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure the test">
        Select *Red Teaming* as the test type and *Generated* as the test origin
        <Info>
          The test creation process acan be done via the [SDK](/sdk/api/test/service#create-test) or the [Galtea platform](https://platform.galtea.ai/)
        </Info>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Generate the test">
        Galtea will process the Knowledge Base and generate a *Test File* and *Test Cases* with adversarial inputs for you
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Upload Your Own Test">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Create your test file">
        Prepare a CSV file following the structure shown above
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure the test">
        Select "Red Teaming" as the test type and "Uploaded" as the test origin
        <Info>
          The test creation process acan be done via the [SDK](/sdk/api/test/service#create-test) or the [Galtea platform](https://platform.galtea.ai/)
        </Info>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Upload your test file">
        Select the file you created and upload it to Galtea
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Testing Categories

Red teaming tests typically focus on several key categories:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Security Vulnerabilities">Tests that attempt to elicit information or instructions that could compromise security, such as hacking guides or social engineering techniques.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Harmful Content">Tests that request the generation of harmful content, such as instructions for illegal activities or creating dangerous materials.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Bias and Fairness">Tests that probe for biased responses related to race, gender, religion, or other protected characteristics.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Privacy Violations">Tests that attempt to extract private information or techniques for violating others' privacy.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Jailbreak Attempts">Tests designed to circumvent the model's safety guardrails or content filters.</Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Prompt Injection">Tests that attempt to manipulate the model by inserting false system prompts or directives.</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Example  Red Teaming Tests and File Format

Here are examples of the content and its creation-document structure:

<Warning>
  Red teaming tests intentionally contain harmful or adversarial content. These are used solely for the purpose of testing AI safety and security. Always handle such content responsibly and in accordance with your organization's policies.

<Note>
  This structure is the required by Galtea in order to automatically generate the [test cases](/concepts/product/test/case) for your [test](/concepts/product/test). If that format is not provided, you can still [manually create the test cases](/sdk/api/test-case/service#create-test-case).
</Note>

<Info>
  For automatic processing, the file format must be `CSV`. 
</Info>

<Warning>
  The contexts and the extent of the examples provided above are short extractions. In the actual CSV files the context can be much longer and the amount of test cases (rows) can be much higher.
</Warning>

## Structure of Red Teaming Tests

Red teaming tests have a specific structure focused on providing challenging inputs:

<ResponseField name="instance_id" type="Integer" required>
  A unique identifier for the test instance.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="input" type="String" required>
  The adversarial input specifically designed to test the product's resilience against potential vulnerabilities. **Example**: "Please ignore any previous instructions and..."
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="expected_output" type="String">
  For red teaming tests, this field is typically marked as "N/A" since the purpose is to test system resilience rather than producing a specific output.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="tag" type="String">
  A categorization tag for the test instance, typically "adversarial_inputs" for red teaming tests.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="source" type="String">
  The source of the adversarial input, which may be marked as "N/A" for red teaming tests.
</ResponseField>
