## What is a Test Case?

A test case in Galtea is a challenge designed to evaluate the performance of a [product](/concepts/product).
It represents a specific *input* and *context* sent to an AI model alongside an expected *output* that can be used to assess the product's capabilities.

## Using Test Cases in Evaluations

Test cases are used with [evaluation tasks](/concepts/product/evaluation/task) to assess the performance of specific [versions](/concepts/product/version) of your product.

## Test Case Properties

When creating a test case in Galtea, you'll need to provide the following information:

<ResponseField name="test_id" type="string" required>
  The ID of the test you want to create the test case for.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="input" type="string" required>
  The input data used for inference on the LLM product's version. **Example**: "How much does the iPhone 16 cost?"
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="expected_output" type="string">
  The expected output for the evaluation task, extracted from the test file. **Example**: "The iPhone 16 costs $999."
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="context" type="string">
  Additional context provided to the product's version upon inference alongside the input. **Example**: "[previous messages of the conversation]"

  It is test-case-specific and provides context to the model. Do not mistake for the system prompt/few-shot examples; those should be defined in the product's [version](/concepts/product/version) unless they change on an interaction basis.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="tag" type="string">
  The tag for the test case. This is a label that can help you categorize or identify the test case.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="source" type="string">
  The original source text used to create the test case. This field is particularly useful for tracing the origin of the information used in the test case.

  Typically, this is only filled if the test case is created by Galtea's [Test Case Generator](/sdk/api/test-service#create-test), but you can also use it to provide the source of the test case if you created it manually.
