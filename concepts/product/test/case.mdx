## What is a Test Case?

A test case in Galtea is a challenge designed to evaluate the performance of a [product](/concepts/product).
It represents a specific *input* and *context* sent to an AI model alongside an expected *output* that can be used to assess the product's capabilities.

## Using Test Cases in Evaluations

Test cases are used with [evaluation tasks](/concepts/product/evaluation/task) to assess the performance of specific [versions](/concepts/product/version) of your product.
