## What is a Test Case?

A test case in Galtea is a challenge designed to evaluate the performance of a particular [version](/concepts/product/version) of a [product](/concepts/product).

It represents a specific set of *inputs* that must be sent to the product's AI model to generate an output. It also can define an *expected output* that can be used to assess the product's capabilities.

<Info>
  Test cases are part of a [test](/concepts/product/test), so you'll need to create a test first. You can do this in the Galtea dashboard or using the SDK.
</Info>

You can **create**, view and manage your test cases on the [Galtea dashboard](https://platform.galtea.ai/) or programmatically using the [Galtea SDK](/sdk/api/test-case/service).

## Using Test Cases in Evaluations

Test cases are used with [evaluation tasks](/concepts/product/version/session/evaluation/task), but first wou will have to create an [evaluation](/concepts/product/version/session/evaluation) using the Galtea dashboard or the SDK.

## SDK Integration

The Galtea SDK allows you to create, view, and manage test cases programmatically.

## Test Case Properties

<ResponseField name="Input" type="Text" required>
  The input data used for inference on the LLM product's version. This is the question or prompt that will be sent to your AI model. **Example**: "What is the operating system of the Samsung Galaxy A8?"
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Expected Output" type="Text">
  The expected output for the evaluation task. This represents the ideal response you want your AI model to provide. **Example**: "The operating system of the Samsung Galaxy A8 is Android 8.1."
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Context" type="Text">
  Test case-specific context that provides context to the model. It can be the past conversation or any other relevant information. Do not mistake for the system prompt/few-shot examples; those should be defined in the product's [version](/concepts/product/version) unless they change on an interaction basis.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Variant" type="Text">
  A label that helps categorize the test case (e.g., "original", "paraphrased", "incorrect"). This corresponds to the `tag` column in an uploaded test CSV file and is used for organizing and filtering test cases.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Source" type="Text">
  The original source text used to create the test case. This can be helpful for tracing where test cases originated from, especially when generating test cases from documentation or other reference materials.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Human Reviewed" type="Boolean">
  Indicates if a test case has been manually reviewed and approved by a user. This is useful for tracking which test cases are considered reliable and validated. The system stores the ID of the user who reviewed the test case, upon creation or update, the one who created or updated the test case is set as the reviewer.
</ResponseField>
