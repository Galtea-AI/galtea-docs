## What is a Version?

A version in Galtea represents a specific iteration of a [product](/concepts/product). Versions allow you to track changes to your product over time and compare different implementations against the same tests.

You can **create**, view and manage your versions on the [Galtea dashboard](https://platform.galtea.ai/) or programmatically using the [Galtea SDK](/sdk/api/version/service).

## Comparing Versions

One of the key benefits of tracking versions in Galtea is the ability to compare different implementations of your product. This allows you to:

- Measure improvements between versions
- Identify regressions in newer versions
- Compare different model providers or approaches
- Make data-driven decisions about which version to deploy

## SDK Integration

The Galtea SDK allows you to create, view, and manage versions programmatically. This is particularly useful for organizations that want to automate their versioning process or integrate it into their CI/CD pipeline.
