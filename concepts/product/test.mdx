## What is a Test?

**A test in Galtea is a group of test cases** designed to evaluate the performance of a [product](/concepts/product). A test file provides simulations of interactions with the product (and, in [quality tests](/concepts/product/test/quality-tests), expected outcomes for each interaction).

You can **create**, view and manage your tests on the [Galtea dashboard](https://platform.galtea.ai/) or programmatically using the [Galtea SDK](/sdk/api/test/service).

## Test Origin

When creating a test in the Galtea dashboard, you'll be asked to specify the test origin:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Generated" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Galtea will take the knowledge base file and generate a set of test cases that will define the test.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Uploaded" icon="file-arrow-up">
    The test is uploaded by you as a complete set of test cases.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Your selection will determine whether you need to provide a *Knowledge Base File* or a *Test File*.

<Info>
  More information on how to create tests can be found in the [Create Quality Tests](/concepts/product/test/quality-tests) and [Create Red Teaming Tests](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-tests) documentation.
</Info>

<Note>
  It is important to note that the information you provide during **product onboarding**, such as the product's description and intended use, plays a valuable role when generating test cases. Galtea can leverage this metadata to generate more targeted and context-aware test cases when creating both quality and red teaming tests, leading to more effective and insightful evaluations.
</Note>

## Test Types

Galtea supports two main types of tests:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Quality Tests" icon="star" href="/concepts/product/test/quality-tests">
    Tests that evaluate the quality and correctness of outputs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Red Teaming Tests" icon="shield-halved" href="/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-tests">
    Tests that evaluate security, safety, and bias aspects
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Using Tests in Evaluations

The [Test Cases](/concepts/product/test/case) of a Test are used in [evaluation tasks](/concepts/product/evaluation/task) to assess the performance of specific [versions](/concepts/product/version) of your product against a set of [metrics](/concepts/metric-type).

<Warning>
  The [Test Cases](/concepts/product/test/case) of a Test should be reused across multiple [evaluations](/concepts/product/evaluation) of distinct [versions](/concepts/product/version) to ensure consistent comparison between different [product](/concepts/product) [versions](/concepts/product/version).
</Warning>

## SDK Integration

The Galtea SDK allows you to create, view, and manage tests programmatically.

## Test Properties

<ResponseField name="Test Name" type="Text" required>
  The name of the test. **Example**: "Legal Document Quality Test" or "Customer Support Safety Evaluation"
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Type" type="Enum" required>
  The type of the test. 
  Possible values:
  - [Quality](/concepts/product/test/quality-tests): Tests that evaluate the quality and correctness of outputs
  - [Red Teaming](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-tests): Tests that evaluate security, safety, and bias aspects
</ResponseField>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Generated">
    <ResponseField name="Language" type="Text">
      The language for generating synthetic test cases if `Knowledge Base File` is provided (e.g., 'english', 'spanish'). This should be the English name of the language. If not provided, Galtea attempts to infer the language from the knowledge base file. Supported languages include English, Spanish, Catalan, French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Dutch, Polish, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese.
      <Note>This field only applies if tests are generated by Galtea (using `Knowledge Base File`).</Note>
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="Max Test Cases" type="Number">
      The maximum number of test cases generated by Galtea. This helps control the size of the test dataset and associated costs.
    </ResponseField>
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Quality">
        <ResponseField name="Knowledge Base File" type="File" required>
          The path to a local file (e.g., PDF, TXT, JSON, HTML, Markdown) containing the knowledge base. This file is uploaded to Galtea, which then generates test cases based on its content. Required if the test cases are to be generated by Galtea. **Example**: "path/to/your/knowledge_base.pdf"
        </ResponseField>
        <ResponseField name="Evolutions" type="List[Enum]">
        {/* In the FrontEnd the variants are shown with the name of Evolutions when the type is Quality */}
          Allows for the generation of variations of test cases (e.g., paraphrased questions, questions with typos). For more details on available evolutions, see [Quality Test Evolutions](/concepts/product/test/quality-evolutions).
        </ResponseField>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Red Teaming">
        <ResponseField name="Threat Types" type="List[Enum]" required>
        {/* In the FrontEnd the variants are shown with the name of Threat Types when the type is Quality */}
          Specifies which [threat categories](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-threats) to generate test cases for.
        </ResponseField>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Uploaded">
    <ResponseField name="Test File" type="File" required>
      The path to a local CSV file containing predefined test cases. This file is uploaded to Galtea. Required if you are providing your own set of test cases instead of having Galtea generate them. **Example**: "path/to/your/test_file.csv"
