## What is an Evaluation?

An evaluation in Galtea is a link between a specific [version](/concepts/product/version) of a [product](/concepts/product) and a [test](/concepts/product/test). It serves as the container for all the evaluation tasks that assess how well the product version performs against the test challenges.

## Creating an Evaluation

To create an evaluation in Galtea, you need to specify:

<ResponseField name="Version" type="ID (text)" required>
  The unique identifier of the version to be used in the evaluation. **Example**: "v2_summarizer_gpt4"
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Test" type="ID (text)" required>
  The unique identifier of the test to be used in the evaluation. **Example**: "legal_docs_quality_test"
</ResponseField>

Once an evaluation is created, you can execute [evaluation tasks](/concepts/product/evaluation/task) to assess the performance of the selected version against the test challenges.

## Evaluation Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Evaluation">Link a specific product version with a test</Step>
  <Step title="Execute Evaluation Tasks">For each challenge in the test, run one or more evaluation tasks to assess performance using different [metric types](/concepts/metric-type)</Step>
  <Step title="Review Results">Analyze the scores and feedback from evaluation tasks</Step>
  <Step title="Compare with Other Versions">Compare results across different versions of the same product</Step>
</Steps>

## Evaluation Dashboard

Once you've created an evaluation, you can access detailed information and results on the evaluation dashboard:

The dashboard provides:

- Overall performance metrics
- Breakdown of scores by metric type
- Detailed view of individual evaluation tasks
- Comparative analysis with other versions (if available)
- Export options for reporting

## Types of Evaluations

Depending on your test type, evaluations can focus on different aspects of your product:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Quality Evaluations">Based on [quality tests](/concepts/product/test/quality-tests), these evaluations assess the correctness, relevance, and overall quality of your product's outputs.</Tab>
  <Tab title="Red Teaming Evaluations">Based on [red teaming tests](/concepts/product/test/red-teaming-tests), these evaluations assess your product's resilience against adversarial inputs and potential vulnerabilities.</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Evaluation Tasks

The core components of an evaluation are its [evaluation tasks](/concepts/product/evaluation/task). Each task represents the assessment of a single test challenge using a specific metric type.
