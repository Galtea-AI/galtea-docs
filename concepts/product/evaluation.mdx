## What is an Evaluation?

An evaluation in Galtea is a link between a specific [version](/concepts/product/version) of a [product](/concepts/product) and a [test](/concepts/product/test). It serves as the container for all the [evaluation tasks](/concepts/product/evaluation/task) that assess how well the product version performs against the test challenges.

## Evaluation Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create an Evaluation">Link a specific [version](/concepts/product/version) with a [test](/concepts/product/test) to create an evaluation</Step>
  <Step title="Execute Evaluation Tasks">For each challenge in the test, run one or more [evaluation tasks](/concepts/product/evaluation/task) to assess performance using different [metric types](/concepts/metric-type)</Step>
  <Step title="Review Results">Compare results across different versions of the same product</Step>
</Steps>

## Evaluation Tasks

The core components of an evaluation are its [evaluation tasks](/concepts/product/evaluation/task). Each task represents the assessment of a single test challenge using specific [metric types](/concepts/metric-type).

<Note>
  Creating an evaluation does not automatically run evaluation tasks. You need to execute tasks separately to generate scores and insights.
</Note>

## Results Visualization

Once you've created an evaluation, you can access detailed information and results on the [platform](https://platform.galtea.ai/).

<Info>
  To view evaluation results, you need to visit a product's page *Analytics* section. For detailed information about a particular evaluation, you can navigate to the *Evaluations* tab and select a specific evaluation.
</Info>

The platform provides:
- Overview of a product's evaluations results per metric
- Analytics comparing different versions of the product
- Detailed view of individual evaluation tasks

## Creating an Evaluation

To create an evaluation in Galtea, you need to specify:

<ResponseField name="Version" type="ID (text)" required>
  The unique identifier of the version to be used in the evaluation.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="Test" type="ID (text)" required>
  The unique identifier of the test to be used in the evaluation.
</ResponseField>

Once an evaluation is created, you can execute [evaluation tasks](/concepts/product/evaluation/task) to assess the performance of the selected version against the test challenges.
