## What is a Scenario?

A **scenario** represents a specific user goal, persona, and interaction context for the [Conversation Simulator](/concepts/conversation-simulator). Scenarios are the foundation for creating realistic, multi-turn tests of your conversational AI. Each scenario guides the synthetic userâ€™s objectives, personality, and approach during simulation.

Scenarios are typically created as rows in a CSV file and uploaded to Galtea to generate [Test Cases](/concepts/product/test/case).

## Scenario Fields

A scenario is defined by the following fields:

<ResponseField name="goal" type="string" required>
  The overall objective the synthetic user is trying to achieve.  
  <br /><b>Example:</b> <code>Book a one-way flight from San Francisco (SFO) to New York (JFK) for next Tuesday.</code>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="user_persona" type="string" required>
  The personality and communication style of the synthetic user.  
  <br /><b>Example:</b> <code>A busy professional who is direct and values efficiency. They prefer to get things done quickly without much small talk.</code>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="initial_prompt" type="string" optional>
  The first message the synthetic user sends to start the conversation.  
  <br /><b>Example:</b> <code>Hello, I am Ivan and I need to book a flight.</code>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="stopping_criterias" type="string" optional>
  A delimited string of conditions that, if met, will cause the simulation to end. Use <code>;</code> or <code>|</code> as delimiters.  
  <br /><b>Example:</b> <code>The user has confirmed the flight booking|The chatbot indicates it cannot fulfill the request;User expresses satisfaction</code>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="max_iterations" type="number" optional>
  The maximum number of conversation turns before the simulation automatically ends.  
  <br /><b>Example:</b> <code>10</code>
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="scenario" type="string" optional>
  A brief description or label for the scenario.  
  <br /><b>Example:</b> <code>Flight booking scenario for business travelers</code>
</ResponseField>

## CSV Example

```csv
goal,user_persona,initial_prompt,stopping_criterias,max_iterations,scenario
"Book a one-way flight from SFO to JFK for next Tuesday","A busy professional who is direct and values efficiency","I need to book a flight","The user has confirmed the flight booking|The chatbot indicates it cannot fulfill the request",10,"Flight booking scenario"
"Cancel an existing reservation","An upset customer who is frustrated with service","I want to cancel my reservation immediately","The reservation is successfully cancelled;The customer is transferred to a supervisor",8,"Cancellation scenario"
```

## How Scenarios Are Used

- Each scenario becomes a test case for the Conversation Simulator.
- The synthetic user's dialogue is guided by the goal and persona.
- Stopping criteria and max iterations control when the simulation ends.
- Useful for testing task completion, robustness, and dialogue quality across a wide range of user types and goals.
