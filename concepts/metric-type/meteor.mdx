title: "METEOR"
description: "Evaluates translation, summarization, and paraphrasing by aligning words using exact matches, stems, or synonyms, computing precision and recall."
---
The **METEOR** (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering) metric is one of the [Classic Metric Type](/concepts/metric-type) Galtea exposes for evaluating machine translation, summarization, and paraphrasing tasks. It aims to correlate more closely with human judgments compared to [BLEU](/concepts/metric-type/bleu).

## Evaluation Parameters

To compute the `meteor` metric, the following parameters are required:

- **`actual_output`**: The model’s generated text.
- **`expected_output`**: The reference (or gold) text to compare against.

---
## How Is It Calculated?

METEOR improves upon [BLEU](/concepts/metric-type/bleu) by considering **semantic and morphological matches**:

1. **Alignment**  
   Tokens are matched between candidate and reference using:
   - **Exact matches**
   - **Stems** (e.g., "run" vs. "running")
   - **Synonyms** (e.g., "big" vs. "large")

2. **Precision & Recall**  
   Both are calculated from the aligned tokens.

3. **Fragmentation Penalty**  
   A penalty is applied if matches are scattered (fragmented alignment).

4. **Final Score**  
   The score is computed as:
   \[
   METEOR = F_{mean} \cdot (1 - Penalty)
   \]
   where \(F_{mean}\) is the harmonic mean of precision and recall.


METEOR returns a score between **0 and 1**:

- **≥ 0.6** – High-quality translation/summary with semantic fidelity.
- **0.3 – 0.6** – Moderate quality; some paraphrasing or structural divergence.
- **< 0.3** – Low-quality or semantically incorrect output.

## Suggested Test Case Types

Use METEOR when evaluating:

- **Machine Translation** with varied phrasings.
- **Abstractive Summarization** where synonyms are common.
- **Paraphrase Detection** with semantic variation.
