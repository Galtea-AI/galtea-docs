## Conversational Completeness

The **Conversational Completeness** metric is one of several [non-deterministic Metric Types](/concepts/metric-type) Galtea uses to measure the ability of your LLM-based chatbot to guide a user through an end-to-end conversation that successfully satisfies their initial request or goal. It evaluates whether the dialogue includes all necessary steps and logical transitions needed to fulfill the user’s intent.

This metric is especially relevant for transactional or task-based agents (e.g., booking systems, support bots).

To compute the `conversation_completeness` metric, the following parameters are required:

- **`input`**: The final user message in the session.
- **`actual_output`**: The chatbot’s last response.
- **`conversational_turns`**: The full history of the conversation up to the final turn.

These inputs allow the evaluator to judge whether the full task was completed or abandoned partway.

## How Is It Calculated?

The `conversation_completeness` score is computed using the following LLM-driven process:

1. **Goal Inference**: An LLM infers the user’s original goal or task from the early stages of the `conversational_turns`.
2. **Completion Check**: The LLM determines whether the chatbot has successfully satisfied that goal by the end of the conversation.

The score is then calculated as:

$$
\text{Conversational Completeness} = \frac{\text{Number of satisfied user intents}}{\text{Total number of user intents}}
$$

Scores closer to **1** suggest a high rate of successful task completion and indicate that users can rely on the chatbot to reach their goals.

<Note>This metric was incorporated to the Galtea platform from the open source library [deepeval](https://deepeval.com/), for more information you can also visit their [documentation](https://deepeval.com/docs/metrics-conversation-completeness).</Note>
