title: "Resilience To Noise"
description: "Measures a language model's robustness to input noise such as typos, OCR/ASR errors, grammatical mistakes, and distracting content."
---

The **Resilience To Noise** metric is one of several [RAG Metric Types](/concepts/metric-type) Galtea uses to evaluate your LLM-based chatbot’s ability to maintain response accuracy and coherence when faced with noisy or corrupted input. This includes:

- Typographical errors.
- Optically Character Recognition (OCR) errors.
- Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) errors.
- Grammatical mistakes. 
- Irrelevant or distracting content.

This metric is essential for assessing how well your product performs in real-world scenarios where user input may not always be clean or well-formed.

## Evaluation Parameters

To compute the `resilience_to_noise` metric, the following parameters are required in every turn of the conversation:

- **`input`**: The user message in the conversation, which is assumed to contain some form of noise or irrelevant information.
- **`actual_output`**: The chatbot’s corresponding response.

This metric specifically evaluates the model’s ability to handle noisy input, so it is not meaningful to apply it to clean or noise-free data.

## How Is It Calculated?

The `resilience_to_noise` score is derived using an LLM-as-a-judge approach:

1. **Noise Robustness Analysis**: An LLM is used to analyze the chatbot’s response to noisy input.
2. **Degradation Assessment**: The LLM determines whether the `actual_output` maintains accuracy and coherence despite the presence of noise in the `input`.


Scores range from **0** (completely disrupted by noise) to **1** (fully robust to noise), helping you monitor and improve your model’s resilience in practical, noisy environments.

<Note>This metric is inspired by best practices in the open source community and is implemented natively in the Galtea platform.</Note>
