## What is an Inference Result?

An inference result in Galtea represents a single turn in a conversation between a user and an AI system. It captures the user's input and the AI's corresponding output, along with other optional metadata such as latency and token usage.

You can **create**, view and manage your inference results programmatically using the [Galtea SDK](/sdk/api/inference-result/service).

## Use Cases for Inference Results

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Log Conversation Turns" icon="comments">
    Store each interaction within a [session](/concepts/session) for later analysis.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Evaluate Individual Turns" icon="clipboard-check">
    Run evaluation tasks on specific turns within a conversation to pinpoint issues.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## SDK Integration

The Galtea SDK allows you to create, view, and manage inference results programmatically. This is particularly useful for logging production data or for evaluating complex conversational flows.
