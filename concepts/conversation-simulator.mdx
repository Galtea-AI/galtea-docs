## What is the Conversation Simulator?

The Conversation Simulator, also known as the **Synthetic User**, is a Galtea feature for testing conversational AI systems. It programmatically generates realistic user messages to simulate multi-turn dialogues, helping you evaluate your AIâ€™s ability to handle complex interactions, maintain context, and achieve user goals.

You can run simulations programmatically using the Galtea SDK. Each simulation is guided by a [Scenario](/concepts/scenarios) attached to a [Test Case](/concepts/product/test/case).

---

## Typical Uses

- **Dialogue flow testing:** Does your AI produce coherent conversations?
- **Role adherence:** Does your AI stay in character?
- **Task completion:** Can your AI achieve user-defined goals?
- **Robustness:** How does your AI handle varied or unexpected user behavior?

## Simulation Result Structure

The simulator returns a result object containing the complete conversation history and metadata:

| Field             | Type    | Description                                                           |
|-------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `session_id`      | str     | The identifier for the simulation session.                            |
| `total_turns`     | int     | Total number of conversation turns in the simulation.                 |
| `messages`        | list    | The full message history as a list of conversation messages.          |
| `finished`        | bool    | Whether the simulation ended naturally (true) or was stopped (false). |
| `stopping_reason` | str/None| If stopped, the reason why the simulation ended.                      |
| `metadata`        | dict/None | Any additional metadata for the simulation.                         |

### Example Output

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "total_turns": 5,
  "messages": [
    {"role": "user", "content": "I need to book a flight."},
    {"role": "agent", "content": "Where are you flying to?"},
    ...
  ],
  "finished": true,
  "stopping_reason": null,
  "metadata": {"scenario": "Flight booking scenario"}
}
```
