## What is the Conversation Simulator?

The Conversation Simulator, also known as the **Synthetic User**, is a powerful Galtea feature designed to test conversational AI systems. It programmatically generates realistic user messages to simulate a multi-turn dialogue, allowing you to evaluate your product's ability to handle complex interactions, maintain context, and achieve user goals.

This is essential for testing:
- **Dialogue Flow**: Does the conversation progress logically?
- **Role Adherence**: Does your AI stay in character?
- **Task Completion**: Can the AI guide the user to a successful outcome?
- **Robustness**: How does the AI handle unexpected but realistic user inputs?

## How It Works: Scenarios

The Conversation Simulator is guided by a **Scenario**, which is a predefined set of instructions that defines the synthetic user's behavior and objectives. A scenario is defined within a [Test Case](/concepts/product/test/case) and can be created by uploading a CSV file with the following columns:

<ResponseField name="goal" type="string" required>
  The overall objective the synthetic user is trying to achieve.  
  **Example**: "Book a one-way flight from San Francisco (SFO) to New York (JFK) for next Tuesday."
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="user_persona" type="string" required>
  The personality and communication style of the synthetic user.  
  **Example**: "A busy professional who is direct and values efficiency. They prefer to get things done quickly without much small talk."
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="initial_prompt" type="string" optional>
  The first message the synthetic user sends to start the conversation.  
  **Example**: "Hello, I am Ivan and I need to book a flight."
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="stopping_criterias" type="string" optional>
  A delimited string of conditions that, if met, will cause the simulation to end. Use `;` or `|` as delimiters to separate multiple criteria.  
  **Example**: `"The user has confirmed the flight booking|The chatbot indicates it cannot fulfill the request;User expresses satisfaction"`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="max_iterations" type="number" optional>
  The maximum number of conversation turns before the simulation automatically ends.  
  **Example**: `10`
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="scenario" type="string" optional>
  A brief description of the scenario for documentation purposes.  
  **Example**: "Flight booking scenario for business travelers"`
</ResponseField>

### CSV Example

```csv
goal,user_persona,initial_prompt,stopping_criterias,max_iterations,scenario
"Book a one-way flight from SFO to JFK for next Tuesday","A busy professional who is direct and values efficiency","I need to book a flight","The user has confirmed the flight booking|The chatbot indicates it cannot fulfill the request",10,"Flight booking scenario"
"Cancel an existing reservation","An upset customer who is frustrated with service","I want to cancel my reservation immediately","The reservation is successfully cancelled;The customer is transferred to a supervisor",8,"Cancellation scenario"
```

## SDK Integration

You can interact with the Conversation Simulator programmatically using the Galtea SDK. This allows you to integrate conversation simulation directly into your testing and evaluation pipelines.
