## What is a Product?

A product in Galtea represents a functionality or service that you want to evaluate. Examples include _QA chat_, _Summarization_, or _Content Generation_.

<Note>Even if your organization has a single public-facing product (like a website or dashboard for all user interactions), you should define separate Galtea products for each distinct functionality you want to evaluate.</Note>

You can **create**, view and manage your products on the [Galtea dashboard](https://platform.galtea.ai/). Products can also be viewed and managed programmatically using the [Galtea SDK](/sdk/api/product/service).

## Related Concepts

A product in Galtea is associated with:

</CardGroup>

## SDK Integration

The SDK allows you to list existing products, retrieve specific products by their ID or name, and delete products. See the [Product Service API documentation](/sdk/api/product/service) for more details.

<Note>Note that product creation is handled through the Galtea platform.</Note>
