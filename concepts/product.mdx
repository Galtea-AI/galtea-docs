## What is a Product?

A product in Galtea represents a functionality or service that you want to evaluate. Examples include _QA chat_, _Summarization_, or _Content Generation_.

<Note>Even if your organization has a single public-facing product (like a website or dashboard for all user interactions), you should define separate Galtea products for each distinct functionality you want to evaluate.</Note>

You can view and manage your products on the [Galtea dashboard](https://platform.galtea.ai/products).
