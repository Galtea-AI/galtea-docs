## What is a Product?

A product in Galtea represents a functionality or service that you want to evaluate. Examples include _QA chat_, _Summarization_, or _Content Generation_.

<Note>Even if your organization has a single public-facing product (like a website or dashboard for all user interactions), you should define separate Galtea products for each distinct functionality you want to evaluate.</Note>

You can view and manage your products on the [Galtea dashboard](https://platform.galtea.ai/products).

## Related Concepts

A product in Galtea is associated with:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <VersionCard />
  <TestCard />
  <EvaluationCard />
</CardGroup>

## SDK Integration

<SDKProductServiceCard />

While products cannot be created via the SDK (creation is done through the Galtea platform), you can use the SDK to list existing products, retrieve specific products by their ID or name, and delete products. See the [Product Service API documentation](/sdk/api/product-service) for more details.
